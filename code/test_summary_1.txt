Winston Smith is a low-rankingmember of the ruling Party in London, in the nationof Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Partywatches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees theface of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure knownonly as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, eventhe people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcingthe implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, whichattempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all wordsrelated to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Suchthoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.
 
As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression andrigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and anyexpression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegallypurchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He hasalso become fixated on a powerful Party member named OâBrien, whomWinston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the mysterious,legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
 
Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he altershistorical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker,a beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that sheis an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He istroubled by the Party’s control of history: the Party claims thatOceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia,but Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Partyalso claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood,is the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausibleto Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorestneighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, livesqualid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.
 
One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-hairedgirl that reads “I love you.” She tells him her name, Julia, andthey begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Partymonitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand storein the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationshiplasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught andpunished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he hasbeen doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia ismore pragmatic and optimistic.
