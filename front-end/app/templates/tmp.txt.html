CHAPTER ONE
Dudley Demented
The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives
and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use of hosepipes had
been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the
inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown
wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a
teenage boy who was lying flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back in a flowerbed outside number four.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of
someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) jeans were torn and dirty, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) T-shirt
baggy and faded, and the soles of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potters
appearance did not endear him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) to the neighbors, who were the sort of people who thought
scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea
bush this evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) was quite invisible to passers-by. In fact, the only way he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) would be spotted
was if his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living-room window and
looked straight down into the flowerbed below.
On the whole, Harry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was to be congratulated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) idea of hiding here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not,
perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth but, on the other hand, nobody was glaring
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), grinding their teeth so loudly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), as had happened every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had tried sitting down in the living room to watch
television with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt and uncle.
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harrys
uncle, suddenly spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Glad to see the boys stopped trying to butt in. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), anyway?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Petunia/Aunt Petunia</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Petunia, unconcerned. <div class="bookquote">``Not in the house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle Vernon grunted.
<div class="bookquote">``Watching the news...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) said scathingly. <div class="bookquote">``Id like to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)s really up to. As if a
normal boy cares whats on the news - Dudley hasnt got a clue whats going on; doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) knows
who the Prime Minister is! Anyway, its not as if thered be anything about his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) lot on our news-''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Vernon, shh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Petunia/Aunt Petunia</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Petunia. <div class="bookquote">``The windows open!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh - yes - sorry, dear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dursleys</b></font>)</div>The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit n Bran breakfast cereal while he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
watched Mrs. Figg, a batty cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) was frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was concealed behind the
bush, as Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) around for tea whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the
street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernons voice floated
out of the window again.
<div class="bookquote">``Dudders out for tea?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At the Polkisses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Petunia/Aunt Petunia</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Petunia fondly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)s got so many little friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)s so popular.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry suppressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about
their son, Dudley. They had swallowed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) dim-witted lies about having tea with a different
member of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) gang every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley
had not been to tea anywhere; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park,
smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them
at it during his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) evening walks around Little Whinging; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had spent most of the holidays
wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way.
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven oclock news reached Harrys ears and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight - after a month of waiting - would be the night.
<div class="bookquote">``Record numbers of stranded holiday makers fill air ports as the Spanish baggage-handlers strike reaches its second week -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Give em a lifelong siesta, I would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreaders
sentence, but no matter: outside in the flowerbed, Harrys stomach seemed to unclench. If
anything had happened, it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and
destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had
been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension
again... and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had
happened yet.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognized for what it really was by
the Muggles - an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident... but the
baggage-handlers strike was followed by news about the drought in the Southeast -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)s
listening next door!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Muggles</b></font>)</div>bellowed Uncle Vernon. <div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) sprinklers on at three in the
morning!'' (<font color='red'><b>actress</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actresss
divorce from her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) famous husband -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``As if were interested in their sordid affairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>sniffed Aunt
Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) could lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) bony hands
on-RRB-.
Harry closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, <div class="bookquote">''-and finally,
Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the
Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water ski! Mary Dorkins went to find out more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes. If they had reached water-skiing budgerigars, there would be nothing else
worth hearing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rolled cautiously on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) front and raised himself on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees and elbows,
preparing to crawl out from under the window.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession.
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a
parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came
from the Dursleys living room, and as though this was the signal Harry had been waiting for he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
jumped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jeans a thin wooden wand
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were unsheathing a sword - but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could draw himself up to full height, the top of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head collided with the Dursleys open window. The resultant crash made Aunt Petunia
scream even louder.
Harry felt as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swayed, trying to focus
on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had barely staggered upright when two large
purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat.
<div class="bookquote">``Put - it-away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle Vernon snarled into Harrys ear. <div class="bookquote">``Now! Before- anyone - sees!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get - off - me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) uncles
sausage-like fingers with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right maintaining a firm grip on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) raised wand; then,
as the pain in the top of Harrys head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and
released Harry as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had received an electric shock. Some invisible force seemed to have
surged through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nephew, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) impossible to hold.
Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straightened up and stared around. There
was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering
through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand hastily back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jeans and tried to
look innocent.
<div class="bookquote">``Lovely evening!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number Seven, who was glaring from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) net curtains. <div class="bookquote">``Did you hear that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious neighbors had disappeared
from their various windows, then the grin became a grimace of rage as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beckoned Harry back
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle
Vernons outstretched hands could resume their strangling.
<div class="bookquote">``What the devil do you mean by it, boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>asked Uncle Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled
with fury.
<div class="bookquote">``What do I mean by what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry coldly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kept looking left and right up the street, still
hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise.
<div class="bookquote">``Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didnt make that noise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry firmly.
Aunt Petunias thin, horsy face now appeared beside Uncle Vernons wide, purple one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>)
looked livid.
<div class="bookquote">``Why were you lurking under our window?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes - yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our window, boy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Listening to the news,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry in a resigned voice.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.
<div class="bookquote">``Listening to the news! Again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, it changes every day, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what youre really up to - and dont give me
any more of this listening to the news tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Careful, Vernon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Petunia/Aunt Petunia</b></font>)</div>breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice so that Harry
could barely hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">''-that your lot dont get on our news!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats all you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
The Dursleys goggled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia said, <div class="bookquote">``Youre a nasty little
liar. What are all those -''  (<font color='red'><b>Petunia/Aunt Petunia</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>), too, lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word,
<div class="bookquote">''- owls doing if theyre not bringing you news?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Get out of that one, boy! As if we didnt
know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) something to tell the truth this time, even though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt at admitting it.
<div class="bookquote">``The owls... arent bringing me news,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said tonelessly.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Petunia/Aunt Petunia</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Petunia at once.
<div class="bookquote">``No more do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon forcefully.
<div class="bookquote">``We know youre up to something funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Petunia.
<div class="bookquote">``Were not stupid, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, thats news to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall and was
striding off up the street.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in trouble now and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have to face his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt and uncle later and pay
the price for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rudeness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not care very much just at the moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had much more
pressing matters on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind.
Harry was sure the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It
was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vanished into thin air. Was it possible
that Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right at this very moment?
As this thought occurred he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared
to be completely deserted and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked on, hardly aware of the route he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was taking, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had pounded these streets so often
lately that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) favorite haunts automatically. Every few steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced
back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder. Someone magical had been near him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lay among Aunt Petunias
dying begonias, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sure of it. Why hadnt they spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), why hadnt they made
contact, why were they hiding now?
And then, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feeling of frustration peaked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) certainty leaked away.
Perhaps it hadnt been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so desperate for the tiniest sign
of contact from the world to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) belonged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was simply overreacting to perfectly
ordinary noises. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) be sure it hadnt been the sound of something breaking inside a
neighbors house?
Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew it the feeling of
hopelessness that had plagued him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) all summer rolled over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) once again.
Tomorrow morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be woken by the alarm at five oclock so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could pay the owl that
delivered the Daily Prophet - but was there any point continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) best friends Ron and
Hermione, though any expectation he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d had that their letters would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) news had long
since been dashed.
We cant say much about you-know-what, obviously... Weve been told not to say anything
important in case our letters go astray... Were quite busy but I cant give you details here...
Theres a fair amount going on, well tell you everything when we see you...
But when were they going to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date.
Hermione had scribbled I expect well be seeing you quite soon inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) birthday card, but how
soon was soon? As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and
Ron were in the same place, presumably at Rons parents house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could hardly bear to think
of the pair of them having fun at The Burrow when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was
so angry with them he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had thrown away, unopened, the two boxes of Honeydukes chocolates
theyd sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) birthday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)d regretted it later, after the wilted salad Aunt Petunia had
provided for dinner that night.
And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), Harry, busy? Hadnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) proved
himself capable of handling much more than them? Had they all forgotten what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done?
Hadnt it been he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered, and been
tied to that tombstone and nearly killed?
Dont think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth time that summer. It was bad
enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kept revisiting the graveyard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nightmares, without dwelling on it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
waking moments too.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed the narrow alleyway down
the side of a garage where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had first clapped eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to
understand how Harry was feeling. Admittedly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) letters were just as empty of proper news as
Ron and Hermiones, but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of
tantalizing hints:
I know this must be frustrating for you... Keep your nose clean and everything will be okay... Be
careful and dont do anything rash...
Well, thought Harry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road and headed
towards the darkening play park, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had -LRB-by and large-RRB- done as Sirius advised. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had at least
resisted the temptation to tie his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) trunk to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) broomstick and set off for The Burrow by himself.
In fact, Harry thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) behavior had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
felt at being stuck in Privet Drive so long, reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing
something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was quite galling
to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban,
escaped, attempted to commit the murder he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) had been convicted for in the first place, then gone
on the run with a stolen Hippogriff.
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass. The park was as
empty as the surrounding streets. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the swings he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sank on to the only one that
Dudley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain and stared
moodily at the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) would not be able to hide in the Dursleys flowerbed again.
Tomorrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>)
escaped the nightmares about Cedric he (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all
finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) supposed had something to do with the
trapped feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) had when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) was awake. Often the old scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) forehead prickled
uncomfortably, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very
interesting any more. In the past, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting
stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) that its
regular irritation was only to be expected... nothing to worry about... old news...
The injustice of it all welled up inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) wanted to yell with fury. If it hadnt been
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>), nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! And his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) reward was to be stuck
in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to
squatting among dying begonias so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! How
could Dumbledore have forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together
without inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) along, too? How much longer was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) supposed to endure Sirius telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and
point out that Voldemort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harrys head,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), the air full of the
smell of warm, dry grass, and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road
beyond the park railings.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not know how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
musings and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty
glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park. One of
them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking noise came from
several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling along.
Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakeably his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin, Dudley
Dursley, wending his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way home, accompanied by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) faithful gang.
Dudley was as vast as ever, but a years hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had
wrought quite a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would
listen, Dudley had recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Champion of
the Southeast. The noble sport, as Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more
formidable than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) had seemed to Harry in their primary school days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had served as
Dudleys first punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin any more but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) still didnt think that Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration.
Neighborhood children all around were terrified of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) - even more terrified than they were of
that Potter boy who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooligan and attended St. Brutuss
Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.
Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered who they had been beating up
tonight. Look round, Harry found himself thinking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watched them. Come on... look
round... Im sitting here all alone... come and have a go...
If Dudleys friends saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) and what
would Dudley do then? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) wouldnt want to lose face in front of the gang, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>)d be terrified
of provoking Harry... it would be really fun to watch Dudleys dilemma, to taunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>), watch
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>), with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) powerless to respond... and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was ready -
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand. Let them try... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d love to vent some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) frustration on the boys who had
once made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life hell.
But they didnt turn around, they didnt see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered
the impulse to call after them... seeking a fight was not a smart move... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must not use magic...
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be risking expulsion again.
The voices of Dudleys gang died away; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road.
There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the
opposite of what youd have done.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever
Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and any time after that was much too late.
Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came home after Dudley ever again,
so, stifling a yawn, and still scowling, Harry set off towards the park gate.
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses with perfectly manicured
lawns, all owned by large, square owners who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernons.
Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel bright color in the darkness and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) delinquent appearance when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed the householders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road Dudleys gang came into view again; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.
<div class="bookquote">''... squealed like a pig, didnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Malcolm was saying, to guffaws from the others.
<div class="bookquote">``Nice right hook, Big D,''  (<font color='red'><b>Piers</b></font>)</div>said Piers.
<div class="bookquote">``Same time tomorrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>said Dudley.
<div class="bookquote">``Round at my place, my parents will be out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gordon</b></font>)</div>said Gordon.
<div class="bookquote">``See you then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>said Dudley.
<div class="bookquote">``Bye, Dud!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``See ya, Big D!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again. When their voices had
faded once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very
quickly he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) ease,
humming tunelessly.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Big D!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley turned.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) grunted. <div class="bookquote">``Its you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How long have you been Big D then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Shut it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>snarled Dudley, turning away.
<div class="bookquote">``Cool name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``But youll always be
Ickle Diddykins to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said, SHUT IT!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into fists.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont the boys know thats what your mum calls you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shut your face.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You dont tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) to shut her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) face. What about Popkin and Dinky Diddydums, can I use
them then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to demand all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>)
self-control.
<div class="bookquote">``So whove you been beating up tonight?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grin fading. <div class="bookquote">``Another ten-year-old? I
know you did Mark Evans two nights ago -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) was asking for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>snarled Dudley.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) cheeked me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) say you look like a pig thats been taught to walk on its hind legs? Cause thats
not cheek, Dud, thats true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>A muscle was twitching in Dudleys jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how
furious he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was making Dudley; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) was siphoning off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) own frustration into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) cousin, the only outlet he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) had.
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed
a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than
the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps were muffled between
garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other.
<div class="bookquote">``Think youre a big man carrying that thing, dont you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley said after a few seconds.
<div class="bookquote">``What thing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That - that thing you are hiding.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry grinned again.
<div class="bookquote">``Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I spose, if you were, you wouldnt be able to walk and talk at the same time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Dudley look sideways at it.
<div class="bookquote">``Youre not allowed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley said at once. <div class="bookquote">``I know youre not. Youd get expelled from that
freak school you go to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How dyou know they havent changed the rules, Big D?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They havent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>said Dudley, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) didnt sound completely convinced.
Harry laughed softly.
<div class="bookquote">``You havent got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley snarled.
<div class="bookquote">``Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten year old. You know
that boxing title you keep banging on about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) was sixteen, for your information,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>snarled Dudley, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) was out cold for twenty minutes
after Id finished with him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) was twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had
that thing out -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harrys wand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not this brave at night, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>sneered Dudley.
<div class="bookquote">``This is night, Diddykins. Thats what we call it when it goes all dark like this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean when youre in bed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley snarled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin.
From the little he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see of Dudleys large face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) was wearing a strangely triumphant look.
<div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean, Im not brave when Im in bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>s aid Harry, completely nonplussed. <div class="bookquote">``What
am I supposed to be frightened of, pillows or something?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I heard you last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>said Dudley breathlessly. <div class="bookquote">``Talking in your sleep. Moaning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) stomach.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) had revisited the graveyard last night in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) dreams.
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter, then adopted a high-pitched whimpering voice.
<div class="bookquote">''Dont kill Cedric! Dont kill Cedric! Whos Cedric - your boyfriend?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I - youre lying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry automatically. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth had gone dry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew Dudley wasnt lying - how else would he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) know about Cedric?
<div class="bookquote">``Dad! Help me, Dad! He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)s going to kill me, Dad! Boo hoo!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shut up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Shut up, Dudley, Im warning you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)s killed Cedric! Dad, help me! He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)s
going to - dont you point that thing at me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudleys heart. Harry
could feel fourteen years hatred of Dudley pounding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) veins - what wouldnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) give to
strike now, to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>)d have to crawl home like an insect, struck dumb,
sprouting feelers...
<div class="bookquote">``Dont ever talk about that again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Harry snarled. <div class="bookquote">``Dyou understand me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Point that thing somewhere else!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said, do you understand me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Point it somewhere else!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``GET THAT THING AWAY FROM -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) had been doused in icy water.
Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch black and
lightless - the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The
distant rumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening was suddenly
piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, silent darkness, as though
some giant hand had dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.
For a split second Harry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d been resisting as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could - then his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reason caught up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) senses - he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didnt
have the power to turn off the stars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head this way and that, trying to see
something, but the darkness pressed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes like a weightless veil.
Dudleys terrified voice broke in Harrys ear.
<div class="bookquote">``W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im not doing anything! Shut up and dont move!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I c-cant see! Ive g-gone blind! I -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said shut up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry stood stock still, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sightless eyes left and right. The cold was so intense he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms and the hairs on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck
were standing up - he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly around, unseeing.
It was impossible... they couldnt be here... not in Little Whinging... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strained his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
would hear them before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw them...
<div class="bookquote">``Ill t-tell Dad!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dudley whimpered. <div class="bookquote">``W-where are you? What are you d-do--?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you shut up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry hissed, <div class="bookquote">``Im trying to lis --''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard just the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been dreading.
There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, something that was drawing long,
hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood trembling in the freezing
air.
<div class="bookquote">``C-cut it out! Stop doing it! Ill h-hit you, I swear I will!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dudley, shut--''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>WHAM.
A fist made contact with the side of Harrys head, lifting him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. Small white lights
popped in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes. For the second time in an hour Harry felt as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head had
been cleaved in two; next moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had landed hard on the ground and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand had flown out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``You moron, Dudley!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes watering with pain as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands
and knees, feeling around frantically in the blackness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Dudley blundering away, hitting
the alley fence, stumbling.
<div class="bookquote">``DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOURE RUNNING RIGHT AT IT!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>There was a horrible squealing yell and Dudleys footsteps stopped. At the same moment, Harry
felt a creeping chill behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that could mean only one thing. There was more than one.
<div class="bookquote">``DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH
SHUT! Wand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered frantically, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands flying over the ground like spiders.
<div class="bookquote">``Wheres - wand -come on -lumos!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) search - and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right hand - the wand tip had ignited. Harry
snatched it up, scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet and turned around.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), hovering over the ground, no feet
or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it came.
Stumbling backwards, Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand.
<div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A silvery wisp of vapour shot from the tip of the wand and the Dementor slowed, but the spell
hadnt worked properly; tripping over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own feet, Harry retreated further as the Dementor bore
down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), panic fogging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain -concentrate -
A pair of grey, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the Dementors robes, reaching for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). A
rushing noise filled Harrys ears.
<div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice sounded dim and distant. Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted
from the wand - he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldnt do it any more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldnt work the spell.
There was laughter inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could smell the
Dementors putrid, death-cold breath filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own lungs, drowning him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) - think... something
happy...
But there was no happiness in him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... the Dementors icy fingers were closing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat - the
high-pitched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head: <div class="bookquote">``Bow
to death, Harry... it might even be painless... I would no t know... I have never died...''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was never going to see Ron and Hermione again -
And their faces burst clearly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mind as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fought for breath.
<div class="bookquote">``EXPECTO PATRONUM!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harrys wand; its antlers caught the Dementor in
the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backwards, weightless as darkness,
and as the stag charged, the Dementor swooped away, bat-like and defeated.
<div class="bookquote">``THIS WAY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sprinted down the alleyway,
holding the lit wand aloft. <div class="bookquote">``DUDLEY? DUDLEY!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had run barely a dozen steps when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached them: Dudley was curled up on the ground, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>)
arms clamped over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) face. A second Dementor was crouching low over him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>), gripping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>)
wrists in its slimy hands, prizing them slowly almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head
towards Dudleys face as though about to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``GET IT!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the silver stag he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had conjured
came galloping past him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). The Dementors eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudleys when
the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared
away and was absorbed into the darkness; the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and
dissolved into silver mist.
Moon, stars and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze swept the alleyway. Trees
rustled in neighboring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the
air again.
Harry stood quite still, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to normality. After a
moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) became aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) T-shirt was sticking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was drenched in sweat.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in Little Whinging.
Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking. Harry bent down to see whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in a fit state to stand up, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard loud, running footsteps behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Instinctively raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) span on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heel to face the newcomer.
Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) grizzled grey hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) wrist and her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) feet were halfway out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand hurriedly out of sight, but-
<div class="bookquote">``Dont put it away idiot boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) shrieked. <div class="bookquote">``What if there are more of them around? Oh, Im
going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!''
 (<font color='red'><b>A Peck</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER TWO
A Peck of Owls
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) left!''  (<font color='red'><b>Owls</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons

Dementors! Its just lucky I put Mr. Tibbies on the case! But we havent got time to stand
around! Hurry, now, weve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble this is going to cause! I will kill
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tibbies</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But -''  (<font color='red'><b>batty neighbor</b></font>)</div>The revelation that his (<font color='blue'><b>Peck</b></font>) batty old cat-obsessed neighbor knew what Dementors were was
almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway. <div class="bookquote">``Youre - youre a
witch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was I supposed to help you fight

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This Mundungus has been following me? Hang on - it was him (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) Disapparated from the front
of my house!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, yes, but luckily Id stationed Mr. Tibbies under a car just in case, and Mr. Tibbies
came and warned me, but by the time I got to your house youd gone - and now - oh, whats
Dumbledore going to say? You!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley floor. <div class="bookquote">``Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know Dumbledore?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesnt know Dumbledore? But come on - Ill be no help if
they come back, Ive never so much as transfigured a teabag.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) stooped down, seized one of Dudleys massive arms in her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) wizened hands and tugged.
<div class="bookquote">``Get up, you useless lump, get up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>But Dudley either could not or would not move. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) remained on the ground, trembling and
ashen-faced, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) mouth shut very tight.
<div class="bookquote">``Ill do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry took hold of Dudleys arm and h heaved. With an enormous effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) managed to hoist him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) face; the moment Harry let go of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swayed
dangerously.
<div class="bookquote">``Hurry up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg hysterically.
Harry pulled one of Dudleys massive arms around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own shoulders and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) towards
the road, sagging slightly under the weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering
anxiously around the corner.
<div class="bookquote">``Keep your wand out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) told Harry, as they entered Wisteria Walk. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, theres going to be hell to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery... this was exactly what
Dumbledore was afraid of - Whats that at the end of the street? Oh, its just Mr. Prentice...
dont put your wand away, boy, dont I keep telling you Im no use?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>It was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul Dudley along at the same time. Harry gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent
movement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) was slumped on Harrys shoulder, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) large feet dragging along the ground.
<div class="bookquote">``Why didnt you tell me youre a Squib, Mrs. Figg?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>asked Harry, panting with the effort to keep
walking. <div class="bookquote">``All those times I came round your house - why didnt you say anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dumbledores orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young.
Im sorry I gave you such a miserable time, Harry, but the Dursleys would never have let you
come if theyd thought you enjoyed it. It wasnt easy, you know... but oh my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) said
tragically, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) hands once more, <div class="bookquote">``when Dumbledore hears about this - how could
Mundungus have left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was supposed to be on duty until midnight - where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)? How am I

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ive got an owl, you can borrow her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry groaned, wondering whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spine was going to
snap under Dudleys weight.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, you dont understand! Dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible, the Ministry
have their own ways of detecting underage magic, theyll know already, you mark my words.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I was getting rid of Dementors, I had to use magic - theyre going to be more worried about
what Dementors were doing floating around Wisteria Walk, surely?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, I wish it were so, but Im afraid - MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO
KILL YOU!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>There was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a
squat, unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialized right in front of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had short,
bandy legs, long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot, baggy eyes that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the doleful look of
a basset hound. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was also clutching a silvery bundle that Harry recognized at once as an
Invisibility Cloak.
<div class="bookquote">``Sup, Figgy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, staring from Mrs. Figg to Harry and Dudley. <div class="bookquote">``What appened to staying

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ill give you undercover!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Figg. <div class="bookquote">``Dementors, you useless, skiving sneak thief!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dementors?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Mundungus, aghast. <div class="bookquote">``Dementors, ere?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>shrieked Mrs. Figg. <div class="bookquote">``Dementors attacking

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Blimey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mundungus/Mundungus Fletcher/MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER</b></font>)</div>said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. Figg to Harry, and back again. <div class="bookquote">``Blimey, I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didnt I tell you not to go? Didnt I!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I - well, I -''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. <div class="bookquote">``It -- it was a very good business
opportunity, see -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) string bag dangled and whacked Mundungus around the
face and neck with it; judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food.
<div class="bookquote">``Ouch - gerroff - gerroff, you mad old bat! Someones gotta tell Dumbledore!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes - they - have!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>yelled Mrs. Figg, swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of Mundungus
she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) could reach. <div class="bookquote">``And - it - had - better - be - you - and - you - can - tell - him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) - why - you -

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Keep your airnet on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mundungus/Mundungus Fletcher/MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER</b></font>)</div>said Mundungus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) arms over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) head, cowering. <div class="bookquote">``Im going, Im
going!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And with another loud crack, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) vanished.
<div class="bookquote">``I hope Dumbledore murders him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg furiously. <div class="bookquote">``Now come on, Harry, what are
you waiting for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry decided not to waste his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remaining breath on pointing out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could barely walk under
Dudleys bulk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) gave the semi-conscious Dudley a heave and staggered onwards.
<div class="bookquote">``Ill take you to the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg, as they turned into Privet Drive. <div class="bookquote">``Just in case there are
more of them around... oh my word, what a catastrophe... and you had to fight them off

no good crying over spilt potion, I suppose... but the cats among the pixies now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry panted, <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledores... been having... me followed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) has,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Did you expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) to let you wander around on your own after what happened in June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent...
right... get inside and stay there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) said, as they reached number four. <div class="bookquote">``I expect someone will
be in touch with you soon enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>asked Harry quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``Im going straight home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg, staring around the dark street and shuddering. <div class="bookquote">``Ill
need to wait for more instructions. Just stay in the house. Goodnight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hang on, dont go yet! I want to know -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>But Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping, string bag clanking.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry shouted after her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact
with Dumbledore; but within seconds Mrs. Figg was swallowed by the darkness. Scowling,
Harry readjusted Dudley on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slow, painful way up number fours
garden path.
The hall light was on. Harry stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand back inside the waistband of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jeans, rang the bell
and watched Aunt Petunias outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass
in the front door.
<div class="bookquote">``Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite - quite -Diddy, whats the matter!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm just in time. Dudley
swayed on the spot for a moment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) face pale green... then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) mouth and vomited
all over the doormat.
<div class="bookquote">``DIDDY! Diddy, whats the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harrys uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus moustache blowing hither and
thither as it always did when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was agitated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hurried forwards to help Aunt Petunia negotiate
a weak-kneed Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>VERNON</b></font>)s ill, Vernon!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is it, son? Whats happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss give you something foreign for tea?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you been lying on the ground?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hang on - you havent been mugged, have you, son?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Petunia screamed.
<div class="bookquote">``Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak to Mummy! What did they
do to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the kerfuffle nobody</b></font>)</div>In all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) perfectly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
managed to slip inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door and, while the Dursleys made
their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and quietly
towards the stairs.
<div class="bookquote">``Who did it, son? Give us names. Well get them, dont worry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shh! He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)s trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy? Tell Mummy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harrys foot was on the bottom-most stair when Dudley found his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>Diddy</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced for the explosion.
<div class="bookquote">``BOY! COME HERE!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foot slowly from the stair and
turned to follow the Dursleys.
The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside. Aunt
Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) was still very green and clammy-looking. Uncle
Vernon standing in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, narrowed eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``What have you done to my son?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said in a menacing growl.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon wouldnt believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) do to you, Diddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Petunia said in a quavering voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudleys leather jacket. <div class="bookquote">``Was it - was it you-know-what, darling? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Diddy</b></font>) use - his (<font color='blue'><b>Diddy</b></font>) thing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``I didnt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and Uncle Vernon raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) fists. <div class="bookquote">``I didnt do anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Diddy</b></font>), it wasnt me, it was -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window. Narrowly
missing the top of Uncle Vernons head, it soared across the kitchen, dropped the large
parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harrys feet, turned gracefully, the tips of its
wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off across the garden.
<div class="bookquote">``OWLS!''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon/VERNON</b></font>)</div>bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) temple pulsing angrily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)
slammed the kitchen window shut. <div class="bookquote">``OWLS AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS
IN MY HOUSE!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart
pounding somewhere in the region of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Adams apple.
Dear Mr. Potter,
We have received intelligence that you performed the Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes
past nine this evening in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle.
The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has
resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ministry
representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.
As you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under Section 13 of the
International Confederation of Warlocks Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform you that your
presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic at 9 a.m. on the twelfth of
August.
Hoping you are well,
Yours sincerely,
Mafalda Hopkirk

Harry read the letter through twice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Witchcraft</b></font>) was only vaguely aware of Uncle Vernon and Aunt
Petunia talking. Inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) head, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) consciousness
like a paralyzing dart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) was never going back.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced, shouting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) fists still raised;
Aunt Petunia had her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) arms around Dudley, who was retching again.
Harrys temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. Ministry representatives will be calling
at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand. There was only one thing for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
would have to run - now. Where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to go, Harry didnt know, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was certain of
one thing: at Hogwarts or outside it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) needed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) wand. In an almost dream like state, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) pulled
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) wand out and turned to leave the kitchen.
<div class="bookquote">``Where dyou think youre going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>yelled Uncle Vernon. When Harry didnt reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pounded
across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall. <div class="bookquote">``I havent finished with you, boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get out of the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``Youre going to stay here and explain how my son-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you dont get out of the way Im going to jinx you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, raising the wand.
<div class="bookquote">``You cant pull that one on me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>snarled Uncle Vernon. <div class="bookquote">``I know youre not allowed to use it
outside that madhouse you call a school!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The madhouse has chucked me out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``So I can do whatever I like. Youve got three
seconds. One - two -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen. Aunt Petunia screamed, Hide! Uncle Vernon yelled
and ducked, but for the third time that night Harry was searching for the source of a disturbance
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not made. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spotted it at once: a dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting outside
on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed window.
Ignoring Uncle Vernons anguished yell of OWLS! Harry crossed the room at a run and
wrenched the window open. The owl stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was
tied, shook its leathers, and took off the moment Harry had taken the letter. Hands shaking,
Harry unfurled the second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.
Harry --
Dumbledores just arrived at the Ministry and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s trying to sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE
YOUR AUNT AND UNCLES HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC. DO NOT
SURRENDER YOUR WAND.
Arthur Weasley
Dumbledore was trying to sort it all out... what did that mean? How much power did
Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of Magic? Was there a chance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) might be
allowed back to Hogwarts, then? A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harrys chest, almost
immediately strangled by panic - how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) supposed to refuse to surrender his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand without
doing magic? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d have to duel with the Ministry representatives, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d be
lucky to escape Azkaban, let alone expulsion.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind was racing... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could run for it and risk being captured by the Ministry, or stay put
and wait for them to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was much more tempted by the former course, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
knew Mr. Weasley had his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) best interests at heart... and after all, Dumbledore had sorted out
much worse than this before.
<div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said, <div class="bookquote">``Ive changed my mind, Im staying.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flung himself down at the kitchen
table and faced Dudley and Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared taken aback at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) abrupt
change of mind. Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon. The vein in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) purple
temple was throbbing worse than ever.
<div class="bookquote">``Who are all these ruddy owls from?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) growled.
<div class="bookquote">``The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry calmly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears to catch any noises outside, in case the Ministry representatives were
approaching, and it was easier and quieter to answer Uncle Vernons questions than to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)
start raging and bellowing. <div class="bookquote">``The second one was from my friend Rons dad, who works at the
Ministry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ministry of Magic?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>bellowed Uncle Vernon. <div class="bookquote">``People like you in government! Oh, this explains everything, everything, no wonder the countrys going to the dogs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>), then spat out, <div class="bookquote">``And why have you
been expelled?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because I did magic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``AHA!''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon/VERNON</b></font>)</div>roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) fist down on top of the fridge, which sprang open;
several of Dudleys low-fat snacks toppled out and burst on the floor. <div class="bookquote">``So you admit it! What did
you do to Dudley?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, slightly less calmly. <div class="bookquote">``That wasnt me -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made
flapping gestures at Harry to quieten him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) while they both bent low over Dudley.
<div class="bookquote">``Go on, son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon/VERNON</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon, <div class="bookquote">``what did he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon/VERNON</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell us, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>whispered Aunt Petunia.
<div class="bookquote">``Pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wand at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley mumbled.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I did, but I didnt use -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry began angrily, but -
<div class="bookquote">``SHUT UP!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison.
<div class="bookquote">``Go on, son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>repeated Uncle Vernon, moustache blowing about furiously.
<div class="bookquote">``All went dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. <div class="bookquote">``Everything dark. And then I h-heard...
things. Inside m-my head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror. If their least favorite thing in
the world was magic - closely followed by neighbors who cheated more than they did on the
hosepipe ban - people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They obviously
thought Dudley was losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) mind.
<div class="bookquote">``What sort of things did you hear, Popkin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Petunia/Aunt Petunia</b></font>)</div>breathed Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with
tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) eyes.
But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) shuddered again and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) large blond head, and
despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt
a certain curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life. What
would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced to hear?
<div class="bookquote">``How come you fell over, son?''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon/VERNON</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon, in an unnaturally quiet voice, the kind of
voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person.
<div class="bookquote">``T-tripped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>said Dudley shakily. <div class="bookquote">``And then -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) gestured at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) massive chest. Harry understood. Dudley was remembering the clammy cold
that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you.
<div class="bookquote">``Horrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>croaked Dudley. <div class="bookquote">``Cold. Really cold.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon, in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudleys forehead to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) temperature. <div class="bookquote">``What happened then, Dudders?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Felt... felt... felt... as if... as if...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As if youd never be happy again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry supplied dully.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley/Dudley Dursley/Dursley</b></font>)</div>Dudley whispered, still trembling.
<div class="bookquote">``So!''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon/VERNON</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable volume as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) straightened up.
<div class="bookquote">``You put some crackpot spell on my son so he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)d hear voices and believe he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was - was doomed to
misery, or something, did you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How many times do I have to tell you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, temper and voice both rising. <div class="bookquote">``It wasnt me! It was a couple of Dementors!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A couple of - whats this codswallop?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``De - men - tors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry slowly and clearly. <div class="bookquote">``Two of them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what the ruddy hell are Dementors?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,''  (<font color='red'><b>Petunia/Aunt Petunia</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Petunia.
Two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before Aunt Petunia clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) hand over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) mouth as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) had let slip a disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon was goggling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>).
Harrys brain reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thing - but Aunt Petunia?
<div class="bookquote">``How dyou know that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>), astonished.
Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) glanced at Uncle Vernon in fearful apology,
then lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hand slightly to reveal her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) horsy teeth.
<div class="bookquote">``I heard - that awful boy - telling her (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) about them - years ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) said jerkily.
<div class="bookquote">``If you mean my mum and dad, why dont you use their names?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry loudly, but Aunt
Petunia ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) seemed horribly flustered.
Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years ago, in the course of which Aunt Petunia had
screamed that Harrys mother had been a freak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was astounded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so
long, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) usually put all her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) energies into pretending it didnt exist.
Uncle Vernon opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) mouth, closed it again, opened it once more, shut it, then, apparently
struggling to remember how to talk, opened it for a third time and croaked, <div class="bookquote">``So - so - they - er -
they - er - they actually exist, do they - er - Dementy-whatsits?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon/VERNON</b></font>)</div>Aunt Petunia nodded.
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was going to
shout April Fool! When nobody did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth yet again, but was spared the
struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening. It zoomed through the
still-open window like a feathery cannon-ball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table,
causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking
envelope from the owls beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night.
<div class="bookquote">``Enough - effing - owls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the window and
slamming it shut again.
Dear Mr. Potter,
Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised
its decision to destroy your wand forthwith. You may retain your wand until your disciplinary
hearing on the twelfth of August, at which time an official decision will be taken.
Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the
Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time. You
should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further enquiries.
With best wishes,
Yours sincerely,
Mafalda Hopkirk

Ministry of Magic
Harry read this letter through three times in quick succession. The miserable knot in his (<font color='blue'><b>Witchcraft</b></font>) chest
loosened slightly with the relief of Knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Witchcraft</b></font>) was not yet definitely expelled, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Witchcraft</b></font>) fears
were by no means banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of August.
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon/VERNON</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) surroundings. <div class="bookquote">``What now? Have they
sentenced you to anything? Do your lot have the death penalty?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) added as a hopeful
afterthought.
<div class="bookquote">``Ive got to go to a hearing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``And theyll sentence you there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wont give up hope, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon nastily.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, if thats all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, getting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was desperate to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Hermione or Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>bellowed Uncle Vernon. <div class="bookquote">``SIT BACK DOWN!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry impatiently.
<div class="bookquote">``DUDLEY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>roared Uncle Vernon. <div class="bookquote">``I want to know exactly what happened to my son!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``FINE!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>yelled Harry, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) temper, red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, still clutched in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand. All three Dursleys flinched, looking terrified.
<div class="bookquote">``Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry,
speaking fast, fighting to control his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) temper. <div class="bookquote">``Dudley thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>)d be smart with me, I pulled out
my wand but didnt use it. Then two Dementors turned up --''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But what ARE Dementoids?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>asked Uncle Vernon furiously. <div class="bookquote">``What do they DO?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I told you - they suck all the happiness out of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, ``and if they get the chance, they
kiss you -
``Kiss you?'' said Uncle Vernon, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) eyes popping slightly. ``Kiss you?''
``Its what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.''
Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream.
``His (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) soul? They didnt take - he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>)s still got his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) -''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>), as though testing to see whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) could
hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) soul rattling around inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>).
``Of course they didnt get his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) soul, youd know if they had,'' said Harry, exasperated.
``Fought em off, did you, son?'' said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the appearance of a man
struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) understood. ``Gave em the old one-two, did you?''
``You cant give a Dementor the old one-two,'' said Harry through clenched teeth.
``Whys he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) all right, then?'' blustered Uncle Vernon. ``Why isnt he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) all empty, then?''
``Because I used the Patronus -''
WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl came
shooting out of the kitchen fireplace.
``FOR GODS SAKE!'' roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) moustache,
something he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) hadnt been driven to do in a long time. ``I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I
WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!<div class="bookquote">''
But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owls leg. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so convinced that
this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything - the Dementors, Mrs. Figg, what
the Ministry was up to, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out - that for the first
time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was disappointed to see Siriuss handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernons
on going rant about owls, and narrowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most
recent owl look off back up the chimney, Harry read Siriuss message.
Arthurs just told us whats happened. Dont leave the house again, whatever you do.
Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
turned the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing else.
And now his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) temper was rising again. Wasnt anybody going to say well done for fighting off
two Dementors single-handed? Both Mr. Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)d
misbehaved, and were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much damage had
been done.
'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>...A peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house. I wont have it, boy, I wont-''
``I cant stop the owls coming,'' Harry snapped, crushing Siriuss letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fist.
``I want the truth about what happened tonight!'' bar ked Uncle Vernon. ``If it was Demenders who hurt Dudley, how come youve been expelled? You did you-know-what, youve admitted it!''
Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head was beginning to ache again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted more than
anything to get out of the kitchen, and away from the Dursleys.
``I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the Dementors,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, forcing himself to remain calm.
``Its the only thing that works against them.''
``But what were Dementoids doing in Little Whinging?'' said Uncle Vernon in an outraged tone.
``Couldnt tell you,'' said Harry wearily. ``No idea.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head was pounding in the glare of the strip-lighting now. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) anger was ebbing away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt
drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were all staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Its you,'' said Uncle Vernon forcefully. ``Its go t something to do with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else would they be down that alleyway? Youve got to be the only - the only -'' Evidently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) couldnt bring himself to say the word wizard ``the only you know-what for miles.''
``I dont know why they were here.''
But at Uncle Vernons words, Harrys exhausted brain had ground back into action. Why had the
Dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the
alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the
Dementors? Had they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted
they would?
``These Demembers guard some weirdos prison?'' asked Uncle Vernon, lumbering along in the
wake of Harrys train of thought.
``Yes,'' said Harry.
If only his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head would stop hurting, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could just leave the kitchen and get to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dark
bedroom and think...
``Oho! They were coming to arrest you!'' said Uncle Vernon, with the triumphant air of a man
reaching an unassailable conclusion. ``Thats it, isnt it, boy? Youre on the run from the law!''
``Of course Im not,'' said Harry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head as though to scare off a fly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind racing
now.
``Then why -?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must have sent them,'' said Harry quietly, more to himself than to Uncle Vernon.
``Whats that? Who must have sent them?''
``Lord Voldemort,'' said Harry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced and squawked if
they heard words like wizard, magic or wand, could hear the name of the most evil wizard
of all time without the slightest tremor.
``Lord - hang on,'' said Uncle Vernon, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) face screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension
coming into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) piggy eyes. ``Ive heard that name... that was the one who --''
``Murdered my parents, yes,'' Harry said dully.
``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s gone,'' said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of
Harrys parents might be a painful topic. ``That giant bloke said so. He (<font color='blue'><b>bloke</b></font>)s gone.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>bloke</b></font>)s back,'' said Harry heavily.
It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunias surgically clean kitchen, beside the top of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle
Vernon. The arrival of the Dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have breached the great,
invisible wall that divided the relentlessly non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world
beyond, Harrys two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside-down; the Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world, and Mrs. Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; Dementors were soaring around Little Whinging, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) might never return to Hogwarts. Harrys head throbbed more painfully.
``Back?'' whispered Aunt Petunia.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was looking at Harry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had never looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) before. And all of a sudden, for the
very first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mothers sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could not have said why this hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) so very powerfully at this moment. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort being back
might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) life looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) like that before. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) large, pale
eyes -LRB-so unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) sisters-RRB- were not narrowed in dislike or anger, they were wide and fearful.
The furious pretence that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harrys life - that there was no magic
and no world other than the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) inhabited with Uncle Vernon - seemed to have fallen
away.
``Yes,'' Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>bloke</b></font>) came back a month ago. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>bloke</b></font>).''
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hands found Dudleys massive leather-clad shoulders and clutched them.
``Hang on,'' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed
and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them.
``Hang on. This Lord Voldythings back, you say.''
``Yes.''
``The one who murdered your parents.''
``Yes.''
``And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)s sending Dismembers after you?''
``Looks like it,'' said Harry.
``I see,'' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) white - faced wife to Harry and hitching up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
trousers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed to be swelling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) great purple face stretching before Harrys eyes. ``Well,
that settles it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shirt front straining as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) inflated himself, ``you can get out of this
house, boy!''
``What?'' said Harry.
``You heard me - OUT!'' Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt Petunia and Dudley jumped.
``OUT! OUT! I shouldve done this years ago! Owls treating the place like a rest home, puddings
exploding, half the lounge destroyed, Dudleys tail, Marge bobbing around on the ceiling and
that flying Ford Anglia - OUT! OUT! Youve had it! Youre history! Youre not staying here if
some loonys after you, youre not endangering my wife and son, youre not bringing trouble
down on us. If youre going the same way as your useless parents, Ive had it! OUT!''
Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry, Mr. Weasley and Sirius were all
crushed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) left hand. Dont leave the house again, whatever you do. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLES HOUSE.
``You heard me!'' said Uncle Vernon, bending forward now, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) massive purple face coming so
close to Harrys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) actually felt flecks of spit hit his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face. ``Get going! You were all keen to leave half an hour ago! Im right behind you! Get out and never darken our doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in the first place, I dont know, Marge was right, it should have been the
orphanage. We were too damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you,
thought we could turn you normal, but youve been rotten from the beginning and Ive had
enough - owls!''
The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the
air again with a loud screech. Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet
envelope, but it soared straight over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let out a
scream and ducked, her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) arms over her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) face. The owl dropped the red envelope on her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) head,
turned, and flew straight back up the chimney.
Harry darted forwards to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to it.
``You can open it if you like,'' said Harry, ``but Ill hear what it says anyway. Thats a Howler.''
``Let go of it, Petunia!'' roared Uncle Vernon. ``Dont touch it, it could be dangerous!''
``Its addressed to me,'' said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice. ``Its addressed to me, Vernon, look! Mrs. Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, Number Four, Privet Drive -''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) breath, horrified. The red envelope had begun to smoke.
``Open it! Harry urged her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Get it over with! Itll happen anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Petunias hand was trembling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for
an escape route, but too late -the envelope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped
it.
An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning letter
on the table.
Remember my last, Petunia.
Aunt Petunia looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) might faint. She (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) sank into the chair beside Dudley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) face in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) hands. The remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence.
<div class="bookquote">``What is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. <div class="bookquote">``What - I dont -Petunia?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) mother, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) mouth hanging open.
The silence spiraled horribly. Harry was watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt, utterly bewildered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head
throbbing fit to burst.
<div class="bookquote">``Petunia, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon timidly. <div class="bookquote">``P-Petunia?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was still trembling. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) swallowed.
<div class="bookquote">``The boy - the boy will have to stay, Vernon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said weakly.
<div class="bookquote">``W-what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) stays,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was not looking at Harry. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) got to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) feet again.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)... but Petunia...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If we throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) out, the neighbors will talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said.

brisk, snappish manner, though she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was still very pale. <div class="bookquote">``Theyll ask awkward questions, theyll
want to know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)s gone. Well have to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tire.
<div class="bookquote">``But Petunia, dear -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Petunia ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) turned to Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Youre to stay in your room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Youre
not to leave the house. Now get to bed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry didnt move.
<div class="bookquote">``Who was that Howler from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont ask questions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Petunia snapped.

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER THREE
The Advance Guard
Ive just been attacked by Dementors and I might be expelled from Hogwarts. I want to know
whats going on and when Im going to get out of here.
Harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the
desk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dark bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) addressed the first to Sirius, the second to Ron and the third to
Hermione. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) cage stood empty on the desk. Harry paced the
bedroom waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) to come back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head pounding, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain too busy for sleep even
though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes stung and itched with tiredness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back ached from hauling Dudley home, and
the two lumps on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head where the window and Dudley had hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) were throbbing painfully.
Up and down he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) teeth and clenching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) fists, casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) passed the window.
Dementors sent to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>), Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) in secret, then
suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic - and still no one was telling
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) what was going on.
And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose voice had echoed so horribly, so
menacingly, through the kitchen?
Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) still trapped here without information? Why was everyone treating him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) like some
naughty kid? Dont do any more magic, stay in the house...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) kicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) school trunk as he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) passed it, but far from relieving his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) anger he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) felt worse, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)
now had a sharp pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) body.
Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a
small ghost.
<div class="bookquote">``About time!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry snarled, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) landed lightly on top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) cage. <div class="bookquote">``You can put that down,
Ive got work for you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)</div>Hedwigs large, round, amber eyes gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reproachfully over the dead frog clamped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)
beak.
<div class="bookquote">``Come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and
tying the scrolls to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) scaly leg. <div class="bookquote">``Take these straight to Sirius, Ron and Hermione and dont come back here without good long replies. Keep pecking them till theyve written decent-length
answers if youve got to. Understand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)</div>Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) beak still full of frog.
<div class="bookquote">``Get going, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) took off immediately. The moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)d gone, Harry threw himself down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed
without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
now felt guilty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d been irritable with Hedwig; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) was the only friend he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had at number
four, Privet Drive. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d make it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) came back with the answers from Sirius,
Ron and Hermione.
They were bound to write back quickly; they couldnt possibly ignore a Dementor attack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)d
probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) immediate
removal to The Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), stifling all further
thought.
But Hedwig didnt return next morning. Harry spent the day in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedroom, leaving it only to go
to the bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) room through the cat flap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) approaching he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to question her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) about the Howler, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got. Otherwise, the Dursleys kept well clear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedroom. Harry couldnt see the point of forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) company on them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) so angry he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d perform more illegal magic.
So it went on for three whole days. Harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) unable to settle to anything, during which time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) paced his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedroom, furious at the whole
lot of them for leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to stew in this mess; and with a lethargy so complete that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could lie
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of
the Ministry hearing.
What if they ruled against him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? What if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was expelled and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand was snapped in half? What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) do, where would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) go? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew the other world, the one to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) really belonged. Might he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) be able to move
into Siriuss house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had been forced to flee from the
Ministry? Would Harry be allowed to live there alone, given that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was still underage? Or
would the matter of where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went next be decided for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? Had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breach of the International
Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought
occurred, Harry invariably slid off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed and began pacing again.
On the fourth night after Hedwigs departure Harry was lying in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) apathetic phases,
staring at the ceiling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) exhausted mind quite blank, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) uncle entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedroom. Harry
looked slowly around at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Uncle Vernon was wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) best suit and an expression of
enormous smugness.
<div class="bookquote">``Were going out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We - that is to say, your aunt, Dudley and I - are going out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.
<div class="bookquote">``You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are not to steal food from the fridge.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am going to lock your door.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of
the room and closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle
Vernons footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) heard the slamming
of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakable sound of the car sweeping out of the
drive.
Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made no difference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whether
they were in the house or not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
bedroom light. The room grew steadily darker around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lay listening to the night sounds
through the window he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig
returned. The empty house creaked around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). The pipes gurgled. Harry lay there in a kind of
stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in misery.
Then, quite distinctly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard a crash in the kitchen below. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat bolt upright, listening
intently. The Dursleys couldnt be back, it was much too soon, and in any case he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadnt heard
their car.
There was silence for a few seconds, then voices. Burglars, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought, sliding off the bed on to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet - but a split second later it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that burglars would keep their voices down,
and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) snatched up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand from the bedside table and stood facing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedroom door, listening
with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might. Next moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) door swung
open. Harry stood motionless, staring through the open doorway at the dark upstairs landing,
straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears for further sounds, but none came. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hesitated for a moment, then moved
swiftly and silently out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) room to the head of the stairs.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart shot upwards into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat. There were people standing in the shadowy hall below,
silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Lower your wand, boy, before you take someones eye out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said a low, growling voice.
Harrys heart was thumping uncontrollably. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew that voice, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not lower his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand.
<div class="bookquote">``Professor Moody?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said uncertainly.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont know so much about Professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled the voice, <div class="bookquote">``never got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you properly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand slightly but did not relax his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grip on it, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) move. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had very
good reason to be suspicious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had recently spent nine months in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had thought was
Mad-Eye Moodys company only to find out that it wasnt Moody at all, but an impostor; an
impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before being unmasked. But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
make a decision about what to do next, a second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs.
<div class="bookquote">``Its all right, Harry. Weve come to take you away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harrys heart leapt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew that voice, too, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadnt heard it for over a year.
<div class="bookquote">``P-Professor Lupin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said disbelievingly. <div class="bookquote">``Is that you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why are we all standing in the dark?''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said a third voice, this one completely unfamiliar, a
womans. <div class="bookquote">``Lumos.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>A wand-tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry blinked. The people below
were crowded around the foot of the stairs, gazing up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) intently, some craning their heads
for a better look.
Remus Lupin stood nearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>). Though still quite young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>)
had more grey hairs than when Harry had last said goodbye to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes were more
patched and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was smiling broadly at Harry, who tried to
smile back despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) state of shock.
<div class="bookquote">``Oooh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looks just like I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>said the witch who was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) lit wand aloft.
She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) looked the youngest there; she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) had a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short
spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet. <div class="bookquote">``Wotcher, Harry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,''  (<font color='red'><b>wizard</b></font>)</div>said a bald black wizard standing furthest back - he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) had a
deep, slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) ear - <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Remus</b></font>) looks exactly like James.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Except the eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>a wizard</b></font>)</div>said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the back. <div class="bookquote">``Lilys eyes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) nose, was
squinting suspiciously at Harry through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mismatched eyes. One eye was small, dark and
beady, the other large, round and electric blue - the magical eye that could see through walls,
doors and the back of Moodys own head. <div class="bookquote">``Are you quite sure its him (<font color='blue'><b>Remus</b></font>), Lupin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) growled. <div class="bookquote">``Itd be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>). We ought to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) something only the real Potter would know. Unless anyone brought any Veritaserum?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry, what form does your Patronus take?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>Lupin asked.
<div class="bookquote">``A stag,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``Thats him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Mad-Eye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin.
Very conscious of everybody still staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Harry descended the stairs, stowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand in
the back pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jeans as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont put your wand there, boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>roared Moody. <div class="bookquote">``What if it ignited? Better wizards than you
have lost buttocks, you know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who dyou know whos lost a buttock?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the violet-haired woman asked Mad-Eye interestedly.
<div class="bookquote">``Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back pocket!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled Mad-Eye.
<div class="bookquote">``Elementary wand-safety, nobody bothers about it any more.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) stumped off towards the
kitchen. <div class="bookquote">``And I saw that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) added irritably, as t he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) woman rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes towards the ceiling.
Lupin held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) hand and shook Harrys.
<div class="bookquote">``How are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked, looking closely at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``F-fine...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to
remove him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from Privet Drive, and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of factly in the house as though this was a long-standing arrangement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced at the people
surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt very conscious of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had not combed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair for four days.
<div class="bookquote">``Im - youre really lucky the Dursleys are out...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mumbled.
<div class="bookquote">``Lucky, ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the violet-haired woman. <div class="bookquote">``It was me who lured them out of the way. Sent a
letter by Muggle post telling them theyd been short-listed for the All-England Best Kept
Suburban Lawn Competition. Theyre heading off to the prize-giving right now... or they think
they are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernons face when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized there was no All-England
Best Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.
<div class="bookquote">``We are leaving, arent we?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Soon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Almost at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, <div class="bookquote">``were just waiting for the all-clear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where are we going? The Burrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked hopefully.
<div class="bookquote">``Not The Burrow, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, motioning Harry towards the kitchen; the little knot of
wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously. <div class="bookquote">``Too risky. Weve set up Headquarters
somewhere undetectable. Its taken a while...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) magical eye
spinning in all directions, taking in the Dursleys many labor-saving appliances.
<div class="bookquote">``This is Alastor Moody, Harry''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin continued, pointing towards Moody.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry uncomfortably. It felt odd to be introduced to somebody he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d known for a year.
<div class="bookquote">``And this is Nymphadora -''
 (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont call me Nymphadora, Remus,''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>said the young witch with a shudder, <div class="bookquote">``its Tonks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her (<font color='blue'><b>Remus</b></font>) surname only,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>finished Lupin.
<div class="bookquote">``So would you if your fool of a mother had called you Nymphadora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>muttered Tonks.
<div class="bookquote">``And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) indicated the tall black wizard, who bowed. <div class="bookquote">``Elphias
Doge.''  (<font color='red'><b>The wizard</b></font>)</div>The wheezy-voiced wizard nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Dedalus Diggle -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dedalus Diggle/Diggle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Weve met before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dedalus Diggle/Diggle</b></font>)</div>squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) violet-colored top hat.
<div class="bookquote">``Emmeline Vance.''  (<font color='red'><b>A witch</b></font>)</div>A stately-looking witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Sturgis Podmore.''  (<font color='red'><b>A wizard</b></font>)</div>A square-jawed wizard with thick straw-colored hair winked. <div class="bookquote">``And Hestia
Jones.''  (<font color='red'><b>A witch</b></font>)</div>A pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved form next to the toaster.
Harry inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wished they
would look at something other than him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); it was as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had suddenly been ushered onstage.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) also wondered why so many of them were there.
<div class="bookquote">``A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) had
read Harrys mind; the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth twitched slightly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, well, the more the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>said Moody darkly. <div class="bookquote">``Were your guard, Potter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Were just waiting for the signal to tell us its safe to set off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, glancing out of the
kitchen window. <div class="bookquote">``Weve got about fifteen minutes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very clean, arent they, these Muggles?''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>said the witch called Tonks, who was looking around
the kitchen with great interest. <div class="bookquote">``My dads Muggle-born and he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)s a right old slob. I suppose it
varies, just as it does with wizards?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Er - yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Look -''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned back to Lupin, <div class="bookquote">``whats going on, I havent heard
anything from anyone, whats Vol--?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hat
again and Moody growled, <div class="bookquote">``Shut up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Were not discussing anything here, its too risky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>said Moody, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) normal eye on
Harry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) magical eye remained focused on the ceiling. <div class="bookquote">``Damn it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added angrily, putting a
hand up to the magical eye, <div class="bookquote">``it keeps getting stuck - ever since that scum wore it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) popped out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye.
<div class="bookquote">``Mad-Eye, you do know thats disgusting, dont you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks conversationally.
<div class="bookquote">``Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>requested Moody.
Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink, still
watched eagerly by the band of wizards. Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Cheers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>said Moody, when Harry handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) the glass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dropped the magical eyeball into
the water and prodded it up and down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. <div class="bookquote">``I
want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Howre we getting - wherever were going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Brooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Only way. Youre too young to Apparate, theyll be watching the Floo
Network and its more than our lifes worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Remus says youre a good flier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kingsley/Kingsley Shacklebolt/Shacklebolt</b></font>)</div>said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shacklebolt</b></font>) deep voice.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Remus</b></font>)s excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, who was checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Anyway, youd better go and get
packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go when the signal comes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ill come and help you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks brightly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking around with much curiosity and
interest.
<div class="bookquote">``Funny place,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Its a bit too clean, dyou know what I mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is
better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) added, as they entered Harrys bedroom and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned on the light.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house. Confined to it for four days in a
very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after himself. Most of the books he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) owned
were strewn over the floor where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it
aside; Hedwigs cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk lay open,
revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle clothes and wizards robes that had spilled on to the floor
around it.
Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk. Tonks paused at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>)
open wardrobe to look critically at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door.
<div class="bookquote">``You know, I dont think violets really my color,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. <div class="bookquote">``Dyou think it makes me look a bit peaky?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Er -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) over the top of Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, it does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks decisively. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) screwed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) eyes in a strained expression as
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) was struggling to remember something. A second later, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) hair had turned bubblegum pink.
<div class="bookquote">``How did you do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, gaping at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) eyes again.
<div class="bookquote">``Im a Metamorphmagus,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) said, looking back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) reflection and turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) head so that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) hair from all directions. <div class="bookquote">``It means I can change my appearance at will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)
added, spotting Harrys puzzled expression in the mirror behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I was born one. I got top
marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Youre an Auror?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark-wizard-catcher was the only career he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d ever considered after Hogwarts.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks, looking proud. <div class="bookquote">``Kingsley is as well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>)s a bit higher up than me, though. I
only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and Tracking. Im dead clumsy, did you hear
me break that plate when we arrived downstairs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>), straightening up, completely
forgetting about packing.
Tonks chuckled.
<div class="bookquote">``Bet you wouldnt mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harrys forehead.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I wouldnt mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry mumbled, turning away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not like people staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, youll have to learn the hard way, Im afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks. <div class="bookquote">``Metamorphmagi are really
rare, theyre born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand, or potions, to change their
appearance. But weve got to get going, Harry, were supposed to be packing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) added
guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh -- yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, grabbing a few more books.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont be stupid, itll be much quicker if I - pack!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>cried Tonks, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) wand in a long,
sweeping movement over the floor.
Books, clothes, telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk.
<div class="bookquote">``Its not very neat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks, walking over to t he (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) trunk and looking down at the jumble inside.
<div class="bookquote">``My mums got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly - she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) even gets the socks to fold
themselves - but Ive never mastered how she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does it - its a kind of flick -''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) flicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) wand
hopefully.
One of Harrys socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the
trunk.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks, slamming the trunks lid shut, <div class="bookquote">``at least its all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) pointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) wand at Hedwigs cage. <div class="bookquote">``Scourgify.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A few feathers and
droppings vanished. <div class="bookquote">``Well, thats a bit better - Ive never quite got the hang of these householdy
sort of spells. Right - got everything? Cauldron? Broom? Wow! - A Firebolt!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harrys right hand it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pride and joy, a
gift from Sirius, an international-standard broomstick.
<div class="bookquote">``And Im still riding a Comet Two Sixty''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks enviously. <div class="bookquote">``Ah well... wand still in your
jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay, lets go. Locomotor trunk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harrys trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) wand like a conductors baton, Tonks
made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them, Hedwigs cage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)
left hand. Harry followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) down the stairs carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broomstick.
Back in the kitchen Moody had replaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) eye, which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it
made Harry feel sick to look at it. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining
the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) had come across while
rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the Dursleys.
<div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. <div class="bookquote">``Weve got about a minute, I
think. We should probably get out into the garden so were ready. Harry, Ive left a letter telling
your aunt and uncle not to worry -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They wont,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">''- that youre safe -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thatll just depress them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- and youll see them next summer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do I have to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>Lupin smiled but made no answer.
<div class="bookquote">``Come here, boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand. <div class="bookquote">``I need to
Disillusion you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You need to what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``Disillusionment Charm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>said Moody, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) wand. ``Lupin says youve got an Invisibility
Cloak, but it wont stay on while were flying; thisll disguise you better. Here you go -
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rapped him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody
had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be running down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body from the point
the wand had struck.
``Nice one, Mad-Eye,'' said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harrys midriff.
Harry looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body, or rather, what had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body, for it didnt look anything like
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) any more. It was not invisible; it had simply taken on the exact color and texture of the
kitchen unit behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed to have become a human chameleon.
``Come on,'' said Moody, unlocking the back door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) wand.
They all stepped outside on to Uncle Vernons beautifully kept lawn.
``Clear night,'' grunted Moody, his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) magical eye scanning the heavens. ``Couldve done with a bit
more cloud cover. Right, you,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) barked at Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>were going to be flying in close formation.
Tonksll be right in front of you, keep close on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tail. Lupinll be covering you from below Im
going to be behind you. The restll be circling us. We dont break ranks for anything, got me? If
one of us is killed -
<div class="bookquote">``Is that likely?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">''- the others keep flying, dont stop, dont break ranks. If they take out all of us and you survive,
Harry, the rear guard are standing by to take over; keep flying east and theyll join you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mad-Eye</b></font>)ll think were not taking this seriously''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>)
strapped Harrys trunk and Hedwigs cage into a harness hanging from her (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) broom.
<div class="bookquote">``Im just telling the boy the plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>growled Moody. <div class="bookquote">``Our jobs to deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) safely to
Headquarters and if we die in the attempt -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kingsley/Kingsley Shacklebolt/Shacklebolt</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No ones going to die,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kingsley/Kingsley Shacklebolt/Shacklebolt</b></font>)</div>said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shacklebolt</b></font>) deep, calming voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Mount your brooms, thats the first signal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin sharply pointing into the sky.
Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars, Harry recognized
them at once as wand sparks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right leg over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly
and felt it vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was to be up in the air once
more.
<div class="bookquote">``Second signal, lets go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin loudly as more sparks, green this time, exploded high above them.
Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair as the neat
square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and
blacks, and every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind as though the rush of
air had blown it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart was going to explode with pleasure;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d been fantasizing about all summer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was going home... for a few glorious moments, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) problems seemed to recede to nothing,
insignificant in the vast, starry sky.
<div class="bookquote">``Hard left, hard left, theres a Muggle looking up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>shouted Moody from behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>). Tonks
swerved and Harry followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk swinging wildly beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom. <div class="bookquote">``We
need more height... give it another quarter of a mile!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harrys eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see nothing below now but
tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might
belong to Uncle Vernons car... the Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right
now, full of rage about the non-existent Lawn Competition... and Harry laughed aloud at the
thought, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others, the creaking of the
harness holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk and the cage, and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped
through the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy.
<div class="bookquote">``Bearing south!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted Mad-Eye. <div class="bookquote">''Town ahead!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spiders web of lights below.
<div class="bookquote">``Bear southeast and keep climbing, theres some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>called Moody.
<div class="bookquote">``Were not going through clouds!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>shouted Tonks angrily, <div class="bookquote">``well get soaked, Mad-Eye!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>Harry was relieved to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) say this; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands were growing numb on the Firebolts handle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had thought to put on a coat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was starting to shiver.
They altered their course every now and then according to Mad-Eyes instructions. Harrys eyes
were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears ache; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch match against
Hufflepuff in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) third year, which had taken place in a storm. The guard around him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was
circling continuously like giant birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wondered how long
they had been flying, it felt like an hour at least.
<div class="bookquote">``Turning southwest!''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>yelled Moody <div class="bookquote">``We want to avoid the motorway!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>Harry was now so chilled he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought longingly of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming
along below, then, even more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable
to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames... Kingsley Shacklebolt
swooped around him (<font color='blue'><b>Shacklebolt</b></font>), bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight... now Emmeline
Vance was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>) right, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wand out, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head turning left and right... then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), too, swooped
over him (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>), to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore...
<div class="bookquote">``We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure were not being followed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sturgis/Sturgis Podmore/Podmore</b></font>)</div>Moody shouted.
<div class="bookquote">``ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>Tonks screamed from the front. <div class="bookquote">``Were all frozen to our
brooms! If we keep going off-course were not going to get there until next week! Besides, were
nearly there now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Time to start the descent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>came Lupins voice. <div class="bookquote">``Follow Tonks, Harry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the largest collection of lights he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
yet seen, a huge, sprawling crisscrossing mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with
patches of deepest black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual headlights
and streetlamps, chimneys and television aerials. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to reach the ground very much,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom.
<div class="bookquote">``Here we go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>called Tonks, and a few seconds later she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had landed.
Harry touched down right behind her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle
of a small square. Tonks was already unbuckling Harrys trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around.
The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had broken
windows, glimmering dully in the light fro the streetlamps, paint was peeling from many of the
doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are we?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``In a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>Moody was rummaging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) cloak, his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) gnarled hands clumsy with cold.
<div class="bookquote">``Got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it.
The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) clicked the unlighter again; the next lamp went
out; he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining
light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.
<div class="bookquote">``Borrowed it from Dumbledore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>growled Moody, pocketing the Put-Outer. <div class="bookquote">``Thatll take care of
any Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now come on, quick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) took Harry by the arm and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from the patch of grass, across the road and on to the
pavement; Lupin and Tonks followed, carrying Harrys trunk between them, the rest of the
guard, all with their wands out, flanking them.
The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house. A
pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken
gate.
<div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment towards Harrys Disillusioned hand and
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lit wand close to it, so as to illuminate the writing. <div class="bookquote">``Read quickly and memories.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar. It said:
The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld
Place, London.
CHAPTER FOUR
Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place
<div class="bookquote">``Whats the Order of the -?''  (<font color='red'><b>Number Twelve Place</b></font>)</div>Harry began.
<div class="bookquote">``Not here, boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>snarled Moody. <div class="bookquote">``Wait till were inside!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled the piece of parchment out of Harrys hand and set fire to it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand-tip. As the
message curled into flames and floated to the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again.
They were standing outside number eleven; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked to the left and saw number ten; to the
right, however, was number thirteen.
<div class="bookquote">``But wheres -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Think about what youve just memorized,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin quietly.
Harry thought, and no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place,
than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed
swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing
those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on.
Apparently the Muggles inside hadnt felt anything.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.
Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materialized door. Its black paint was
shabby and scratched. The silver doorknocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no
keyhole or letterbox.
Lupin pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard many loud, metallic clicks and
what sounded like the clatter of a chain. The door creaked open.
<div class="bookquote">``Get in quick, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>Lupin whispered, <div class="bookquote">``but dont go far inside and dont touch anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could smell damp,
dust and a sweetish, rotting smell; the place had the feeling of a derelict building. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Lupin and Tonks carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) trunk and
Hedwigs cage. Moody was standing on the top step releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had
stolen from the streetlamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square glowed momentarily
with orange light before Moody limped inside and closed the front door, so that the darkness in
the hall became complete.
<div class="bookquote">``Here -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) rapped Harry hard over the head with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand; Harry felt as though something hot was
trickling down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back this time and knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.
<div class="bookquote">``Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Moody/Mad-Eye/Mad-Eye Moody</b></font>)</div>Moody whispered.
The others hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of foreboding; it was as though they
had just entered the house of a dying person. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insubstantial light
over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby
chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry
heard something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier and the candelabra on a
rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.
There were hurried footsteps and Rons mother, Mrs. Weasley, emerged from a door at the far
end of the hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was beaming in welcome as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hurried towards them, though Harry noticed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was rather thinner and paler than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) had been last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Harry, its lovely to see you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) whispered, pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) into a rib-cracking hug before
holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at arms length and examining him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) critically. <div class="bookquote">``Youre looking peaky; you need
feeding up, but youll have to wait a bit for dinner, Im afraid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) turned to the gang of wizards behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and whispered urgently, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s just arrived, the
meetings started.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
towards the door through which Mrs. Weasley had just come. Harry made to follow Lupin, but
Mrs. Weasley held him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back.
<div class="bookquote">``No, Harry, the meetings only for members of the Order. Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you
can wait with them until the meetings over, then well have dinner. And keep your voice down in
the hall,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) added in an urgent whisper.
<div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont want anything to wake up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ill explain later, Ive got to hurry, Im supposed to be at the meeting - Ill just show you where
youre sleeping.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) finger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) lips, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on tiptoe past a pair of long, moth-eaten curtains,
behind which Harry supposed there must be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella
stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed trolls leg they started up the dark
staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall. A closer look
showed Harry that the heads belonged to house-elves. All of them had the same rather snout-like
nose.
Harrys bewilderment deepened with every step he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took. What on earth were they doing in a
house that looked as though it belonged to the darkest of wizards?
<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Weasley, why -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, Ive really got to dash,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Weasley
whispered distractedly. <div class="bookquote">``There -''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they had reached the second landing, <div class="bookquote">''- youre the door on the
right. Ill call you when its over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hurried off downstairs again.
Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, which was shaped like a serpents
head, and opened the door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded room; then there was a loud
twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vision was completely obscured by a
large quantity of very bushy hair. Hermione had thrown herself on to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in a hug that nearly
knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flat, while Rons tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round and round their
heads.
<div class="bookquote">``HARRY! Ron, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s here, Harrys here! We didnt hear you arrive! Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I bet you have, I know our letters were useless - but we
couldnt tell you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldnt, oh, weve got so much to
tell you, and youve got things to tell us - the Dementors! When we heard - and that Ministry
hearing - its just outrageous, Ive looked it all up, they cant expel you, they just cant, theres
provision in the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic
in life-threatening situations -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) breathe, Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, grinning as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) closed the door behind Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed
to have grown several more inches during their month apart, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) taller and more gangly
looking than ever, though the long nose, bright red hair and freckles were the same.
Still beaming, Hermione let go of Harry, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could say another word there was a soft
whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently
on Harrys shoulder.
<div class="bookquote">``Hedwig!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>The snowy owl clicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) beak and nibbled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ear affectionately as Harry stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feathers.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)s been in a right state,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Pecked us half to death when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) brought your last
letters, look at this -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) showed Harry the index finger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right hand, which sported a half-healed but clearly deep
cut.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said. <div class="bookquote">``Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We wanted to give them to you, mate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Hermione was going spare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) kept saying
youd do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore
made us -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- swear not to tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Hermiones already said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The warm glow that had flared inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) two best friends was extinguished as
something icy flooded the pit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach. All of a sudden - after yearning to see them for a
solid month -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would rather Ron and Hermione left him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) alone.
There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically, not looking at either
of the others.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) seemed to think it was best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione rather breathlessly. <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore, I mean.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) noticed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands, too, bore the marks of Hedwigs beak and found
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not at all sorry.
<div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) thought you were safest with the Muggles -''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron began.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``Have either of you been attacked by Dementors this
summer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, no-but thats why he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry felt a great jolt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) guts as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just missed a step going downstairs. So
everyone had known he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was being followed, except him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Didnt work that well, though, did it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) utmost to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice even.
<div class="bookquote">``Had to look after myself after all, didnt I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was so angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, in an almost awestruck voice. <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore. We saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>).
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) found out Mundungus had left before his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) shift had ended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) was scary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Im glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) left,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said coldly. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) hadnt, I wouldnt have done magic and
Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Arent you... arent you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry lied defiantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked away from them, looking around, with Hedwig nestled
contentedly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spirits. It was dank and
dark. A blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of
the peeling walls, and as Harry passed it he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard someone, who was lurking out of
sight, snigger.
<div class="bookquote">``So whys Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, still trying hard to
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice casual. <div class="bookquote">``Did you - er - bother to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) at all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was behaving just as
they had feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would. It did nothing to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) temper.
<div class="bookquote">``We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``We did, mate. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>)s really busy now, weve only seen him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) twice since we came here and he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) didnt have much
time, he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) said the owls might
be intercepted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) could stillve kept me informed if he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>)d wanted to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said shortly. <div class="bookquote">``Youre not telling me he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) doesnt know ways to send messages without owls.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought that, too. But he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) didnt want you to
know anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) thinks I cant be trusted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, watching their expressions.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont be thick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking highly disconcerted.
<div class="bookquote">``Or that I cant take care of myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) doesnt think that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione anxiously.
<div class="bookquote">``So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys while you two get to join in everything thats going
on here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, the words tumbling over one another in a rush, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice growing louder

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Were not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``Mum wont let us near the meetings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) says were too young -''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) knew it, Harry was shouting.
<div class="bookquote">``SO YOU HAVENT BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! YOUVE STILL BEEN HERE,

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Every bitter and resentful thought Harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>): his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been together without him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fury at
being followed and not told about it - all the feelings he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was half-ashamed of finally burst their
boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off to the top of the wardrobe again;
Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads.
<div class="bookquote">``WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL

HIM? ME!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron was standing there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth half-open, clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to
say, while Hermione looked on the verge of tears.
<div class="bookquote">``BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHATS GOING ON? WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did -''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione began.

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry glared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again, pacing up and
down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe. There was a long pause, broken only
by the mournful creak of the floorboards below Harrys feet.
<div class="bookquote">``What is this place, anyway?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shot at Ron and Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron at once.
<div class="bookquote">``Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its a secret society,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledores in charge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) founded it.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whos in it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, coming to a halt with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pockets.
<div class="bookquote">``Quite a few people -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Weve met about twenty of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, <div class="bookquote">``but we think there are more.''

<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) demanded, looking from one to the other.
<div class="bookquote">``Er,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Well what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Voldemort!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione winced. <div class="bookquote">``Whats happening?

Harrys face.
<div class="bookquote">``Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Theyre really useful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order -''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension.
Harry snorted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked around the room again, looking anywhere but at Ron and Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``So, what have you two been doing, if youre not allowed in meetings?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) demanded. <div class="bookquote">``You said youd been busy''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Rons elder twin brothers, had materialized out of thin
air in the middle of the room. Pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join
Hedwig on top of the wardrobe.
<div class="bookquote">``Stop doing that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly red-haired as Ron,
though stockier and slightly shorter.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, beaming at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We thought we heard your dulcet tones.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You dont want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, also beaming.
<div class="bookquote">``There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didnt hear you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You two passed your Apparation tests, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>asked Harry grumpily.
<div class="bookquote">``With distinction,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, who was holding what looked like a piece of very long, flesh colored string.
<div class="bookquote">``It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Time is Galleons, little brother''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``Anyway, Harry, youre interfering with reception.
Extendable Ears,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) added in response to Harrys raised eyebrows, and held up the string which
Harry now saw was trailing out on to the landing. <div class="bookquote">``Were trying to hear whats going on
downstairs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You want to be careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, staring at the Ear, <div class="bookquote">``if Mum sees one of them again...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its worth the risk, thats a major meeting theyre having,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Fred.
The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, hello, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Rons younger sister, Ginny, brightly. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I heard your voice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Turning to Fred and George, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Its no-go with the Extendable Ears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)s gone and put
an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How dyou know?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, looking crestfallen.
<div class="bookquote">``Tonks told me how to find out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny. <div class="bookquote">``You just chuck stuff at the door and if it cant
make contact the doors been Imperturbed. Ive been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of
the stairs and they just soar away from it, so theres no way the Extendable Ears will be able to
get under the gap.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred heaved a deep sigh.
<div class="bookquote">``Shame. I really fancied finding out what old Snapes been up to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Snape!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds; Fred and
Ginny followed. <div class="bookquote">``Giving a report. Top secret.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Git,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred idly.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)s on our side now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione reprovingly.
Ron snorted. <div class="bookquote">``Doesnt stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) being a git. The way he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) looks at us when he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) sees us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bill doesnt like him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>), either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny, as though that settled the matter.
Harry was not sure his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) anger had abated yet; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thirst for information was now overcoming
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) urge to keep shouting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sank on to the bed opposite the others.
<div class="bookquote">``Is Bill here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was working in Egypt?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) applied for a desk job so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) could come home and work for the Order,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) says
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) misses the tombs, but;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) smirked, <div class="bookquote">``there are compensations.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Remember old Fleur Delacour?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fleur</b></font>)s got a job at Gringotts to eempwve er
Eeenglish -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And Bills been giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fleur</b></font>) a lot of private lessons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>sniggered Fred.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlies in the Order, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)s still in Romania. Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlies trying to make contacts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) days off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Couldnt Percy do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked. The last he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard, the third Weasley brother was
working in the Department of International Magical Co-operation at the Ministry of Magic.
At Harrys words, all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks.
<div class="bookquote">``Whatever you do, dont mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron told Harry in a tense
voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because every time Percys names mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)s holding and Mum
starts crying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred said.
<div class="bookquote">``Its been awful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny sadly.
<div class="bookquote">``I think were well shut of him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Whats happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy and Dad had a row,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``Ive never seen Dad row with anyone like that. Its
normally Mum who shouts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was the first week back after term ended,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``We were about to come and join the
Order. Percy came home and told us he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)d been promoted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Youre kidding?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, Harrys impression was that
Percy had not made a great success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had
committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) boss was being controlled by
Lord Voldemort -LRB-not that the Ministry had believed it - they all thought Mr. Crouch had gone
mad-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, we were all surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``because Percy got into a load of trouble about
Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) rocker and informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) in charge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)
wasnt going to complain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So how come they promoted him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats exactly what we wondered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who see med very keen to keep normal
conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) came home really pleased with
himself - even more pleased than usual, if you can imagine that - and told Dad he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)d been offered
a position in Fudges own office. A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts:
Junior Assistant to the Minister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only Dad wasnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred grimly.
<div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobodys having
any contact with Dumbledore,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.
<div class="bookquote">``Dumbledores name is mud with the Ministry these days, see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``They all think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s
just making trouble saying You-Know-Whos back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone whos in league with Dumbledore can clear out
their desks,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.
<div class="bookquote">``Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)s friendly with Dumbledore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)s always
thought Dads a bit of a weirdo because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) Muggle obsession.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But whats that got to do with Percy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>asked Harry, confused.
<div class="bookquote">``Im coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) office because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) wants to use
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) to spy on the family - and Dumbledore.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry let out a low whistle.
<div class="bookquote">``Bet Percy loved that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) went completely berserk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) said - well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) said loads of terrible stuff. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)s been
having to struggle against Dads lousy reputation ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) joined the Ministry and that
Dads got no ambition and thats why weve always been - you know - not had a lot of money, I
mean -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry cat.
<div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``And it got worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) said Dad was an idiot to run around
with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) - Percy - knew where his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry. And if
Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) was going to make sure everyone
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) didnt belong to our family any more. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) packed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) bags the same night and left.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)s living here in London now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry swore under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had always liked Percy least of Rons brothers, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) had
never imagined he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) would say such things to Mr. Weasley.
<div class="bookquote">``Mums been in a right state,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron dully. <div class="bookquote">``You know - crying and stuff. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) came up to
London to try and talk to Percy but he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) slammed the door in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) face. I dunno what he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) does if he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)
meets Dad at work - ignores him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>), I spose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Percy must know Voldemorts back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry s lowly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)s not stupid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) must know
your mum and dad wouldnt risk everything without proof.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy said the only evidence was your word and... I dunno... he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) didnt think it was good
enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione tartly, and the others all nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you talking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, looking around at them all. They were all regarding
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) warily.
<div class="bookquote">``Havent - havent you been getting the Daily Prophet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I have!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you - er - been reading it thoroughly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked, still more anxiously.
<div class="bookquote">``Not cover to cover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry defensively. <div class="bookquote">``If they were going to report anything about
Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldnt it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The others</b></font>)</div>The others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried on, <div class="bookquote">``Well, youd need to read it
cover to cover to pick it up, but they - um - they mention you a couple of times a week.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Id have seen -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not if youve only been reading the front page, you wouldnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
head. <div class="bookquote">``Im not talking about big articles. They just slip you in, like youre a standing joke.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its quite nasty, actually,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a voice of forced calm. <div class="bookquote">``Theyre just building on
Ritas stuff.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>)s not writing for them any more, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>)s kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) promise - not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>)s got any choice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione added with
satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) laid the foundation for what theyre trying to do now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Which is what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry impatiently.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was
hurting and all that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeters stories about him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in a hurry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, theyre writing about you as though youre this deluded, attention-seeking person who
thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>)s a great tragic hero or something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less
unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly. <div class="bookquote">``They keep slipping in snide comments about
you. If some far-fetched story appears, they say something like, tale worthy of Harry Potter, and if anyone has a funny accident or anything its, lets hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) hasnt got a scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) forehead or well be asked to worship him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) next -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont want anyone to worship -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry began hotly.
<div class="bookquote">``I know you dont,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quickly, looking frightened. <div class="bookquote">``I know, Harry. But you see what theyre doing? They want to turn you into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, Ill bet anything. They want wizards on the street to think youre just some stupid boy whos a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) loves being famous and wants to keep it
going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didnt ask - I didnt want - Voldemort killed my parents!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry spluttered. <div class="bookquote">``I got famous
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) murdered my family but couldnt kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Dont
they think Id rather itd never -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We know, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny earnestly.
<div class="bookquote">``And of course, they didnt report a word about the Dementors attacking you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Someones told them to keep that quiet. That shouldve been a really big story, out-of-control
Dementors. They havent even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy. We
thought they would, it would tie in so well with this image of you as some stupid show-off. We
think theyre biding their time until youre expelled, then theyre really going to go to town - I
mean, if youre expelled, obviously,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) went on hastily. <div class="bookquote">``You really shouldnt be, not if they
abide by their own laws, theres no case against you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think about that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cast around for
another change of subject, but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps
coming up the stairs.
<div class="bookquote">``Uh oh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud crack and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) and George
vanished. Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway.
<div class="bookquote">``The meetings over, you can come down and have dinner now. Everyones dying to see you,
Harry. And whos left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Crookshanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny unblushingly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loves playing with them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasley, <div class="bookquote">``I thought it might have been Kreacher, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) keeps doing odd things like
that. Now dont forget to keep your voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what
have you been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) mother out of the room, leaving Harry alone with
Ron and Hermione. Both of them were watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) apprehensively, as though they feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight of them looking so
nervous made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feel slightly ashamed.
<div class="bookquote">``Look...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttered, but Ron shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head, and Hermione said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``We knew youd be
angry, Harry, we really dont blame you, but youve got to understand, we did try to persuade
Dumbledore -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Harry shortly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cast around for a topic that didnt involve his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) headmaster, because the very thought of
Dumbledore made Harrys insides burn with anger again.
<div class="bookquote">``Whos Kreacher?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``The house-elf who lives here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Nutter. Never met one like him (<font color='blue'><b>Nutter</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione frowned at Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Nutter</b></font>)s not a nutter, Ron.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) lifes ambition is to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron irritably. <div class="bookquote">``Is that normal, Hermione?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well - well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) is a bit strange, its not his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fault.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Hermione still hasnt given up on SPEW -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its not SPEW!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione heatedly. <div class="bookquote">``Its the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.
And its not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Cmon, Im starving.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) led the way out of the door and on to the landing, but before they could descend the stairs -
<div class="bookquote">``Hold it!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Ron breathed, flinging out an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking any further.
<div class="bookquote">``Theyre still in the hall, we might be able to hear something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy hallway below was packed
with witches and wizards, including all of Harrys guard. They were whispering excitedly
together. In the very center of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and prominent
nose of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. Harry leaned further over the
banisters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was very interested in what Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix...
A thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front of Harrys eyes. Looking up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Fred
and George on the landing above, cautiously lowering the Extendable Ear towards the dark knot
of people below. A moment later, however, they all began to move towards the front door and
out of sight.
<div class="bookquote">``Damnit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry heard Fred whisper, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hoisted t he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Extendable Ear back up again.
They heard the front door open, then close.
<div class="bookquote">``Snape never eats here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron told Harry quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God. Cmon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And dont forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered.
As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall, they saw Lupin, Mrs. Weasley and Tonks
at the front door, magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just left.
<div class="bookquote">``Were eating down in the kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Weasley whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the
stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Harry, dear, if youll just tiptoe across the hall, its through this door here -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CRASH.
<div class="bookquote">``Tonks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Weasley in exasperation, turning to look behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Im sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. <div class="bookquote">``Its that stupid umbrella stand, thats the second time Ive tripped over -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) words were drowned by a horrible, ear-splitting, blood-curdling screech.
The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown apart, but there was no door
behind them. For a split second, Harry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was looking through a window, a window
behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were
being tortured - then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized it was simply a life-size portrait, but the most realiztic, and the
most unpleasant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ever seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life.
The old woman was drooling, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face stretched taut
as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) screamed; and all along the hall behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell,
too, so that Harry actually screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes at the noise and clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears.
Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman,
but they would not close and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as
though trying to tear at their faces.
<div class="bookquote">``Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this
place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>Tonks apologized over and over again, dragging the huge, heavy trolls leg back off the floor;
Mrs. Weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall,
stunning all the other portraits with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) wand; and a man with long black hair came charging out
of a door facing Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) roared, seizing the curtain Mrs. Weasley had
abandoned.
The old womans face blanched.
<div class="bookquote">``Yoooou!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) howled, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) eyes popping at the sight of the man. <div class="bookquote">``Blood traitor, abomination,
shame of my flesh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said - shut - UP!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>roared the man, and with a stupendous effort he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again.
The old womans screeches died and an echoing silence fell. Panting slightly and sweeping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
long dark hair out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, Harrys godfather Sirius turned to face him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said grimly, <div class="bookquote">``I see youve met my mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER FIVE
The Order of the Phoenix
<div class="bookquote">``Your -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dear old mum, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``Weve been trying to get her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) down for a month but we
think she (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of the canvas. Lets get downstairs, quick,
before they all wake up again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But whats a portrait of your mother doing here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, bewildered, as they went
through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others
just behind them.
<div class="bookquote">``Hasnt anyone told you? This was my parents house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``But Im the last Black left,
so its mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for Headquarters - about the only useful thing Ive
been able to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and bitter Siriuss voice sounded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement
kitchen.
It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room with rough stone walls. Most
of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room. A haze of pipe smoke hung
in the air like battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and
pans hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into the room for the
meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of them, littered with rolls of parchment,
goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr. Weasley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) eldest
son Bill were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table.
Mrs. Weasley cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) throat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) husband, a thin, balding, red-haired man who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and jumped to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>), and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hand vigorously.
<div class="bookquote">``Good to see you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the
lengths of parchment left on the table.
<div class="bookquote">``Journey all right, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill</b></font>)</div>Bill called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once. <div class="bookquote">``Mad-Eye didnt make you come via Greenland, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately toppling a candle on to the last
piece of parchment. ``Oh no - sorry -
``Here, dear,'' said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) repaired the parchment with a
wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) wand. In the flash of light caused by Mrs. Weasleys charm Harry caught a glimpse
of what looked like the plan of a building.
Mrs. Weasley had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into Bills
already overladen arms.
``This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) snapped,
before sweeping off towards an ancient dresser from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) started unloading dinner plates.
Bill took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) wand, muttered, ``Evanesco!'' and the scrolls vanished.
``Sit down, Harry,'' said Sirius. ``Youve met Mundungus, havent you?''
The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore, then jerked
awake.
Somen say mname? Mundungus mumbled sleepily. ``I gree with Sirius...'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) raised a very
grubby hand in the air as though voting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused.
Ginny giggled.
``The meetings over, Dung,'' said Sirius, as they all sat down around him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) at the table. ``Harrys
arrived.''
``Eh?'' said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) matted ginger hair. ``Blimey, so e
as. Yeah... you all right, Arry?''
``Yeah,'' said Harry.
Mundungus fumbled nervously in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) pockets, still staring at Harry, and pulled out a grimy black
pipe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stuck it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth, ignited the end of it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and took a deep pull on it.
Great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) within seconds.
``Owe you a pology,'' grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud.
``For the last time, Mundungus,'' called Mrs. Weasley, ``will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, especially not when were about to eat!''
``Ah,'' said Mundungus. ``Right. Sorry, Molly.''
The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) pipe back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) pocket, but an acrid
smell of burning socks lingered.
``And if you want dinner before midnight Ill need a hand,'' Mrs. Weasley said to the room at
large. ``No, you can stay where you are, Harry dear, youve had a long journey.''
``What can I do, Molly?'' said Tonks enthusiastically, bounding forwards.
Mrs. Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive.
``Er - no, its all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, youve done enough today.''
``No, no, I want to help!'' said Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hurried towards the
dresser, from which Ginny was collecting cutlery.
Soon, a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord,
supervised by Mr. Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the
others took out plates, more goblets and food from the pantry. Harry was left at the table with
Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) mournfully.
``Seen old Figgy since?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) asked.
``No,'' said Harry, ``I havent seen anyone.''
``See, I wouldnt ave left,'' said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) voice, ``but I
ad a business opportunity -''
Harry felt something brush against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks,
Hermiones bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around Harrys legs, purring,
then jumped on to Siriuss lap and curled up. Sirius scratched him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) absent-mindedly behind the
ears as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) turned, still grim-faced, to Harry.
``Had a good summer so far?''
``No, its been lousy,'' said Harry.
For the first time, something like a grin flitted across Siriuss face.
``Dont know what youre complaining about, myself.''
``What?'' said Harry incredulously.
``Personally, Id have welcomed a Dementor attack. A deadly struggle for my soul would have
broken the monotony nicely. You think youve had it bad, at least youve been able to get out
and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights... Ive been stuck inside for a month.''
``How come?'' asked Harry, frowning.
``Because the Ministry of Magics still after me, and Voldemort will know all about me being an
Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>), so my big disguise is useless. Theres not much
I can do for the Order of the Phoenix... or so Dumbledore feels.''
There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered
Dumbledores name that told Harry that Sirius, too, was not very happy with the Headmaster.
Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) godfather.
``At least youve known whats been going on,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said bracingly.
``Oh yeah,'' said Sirius sarcastically. ``Listening to Snapes reports, having to take all his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) snide
hints that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)s out there risking his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) life while Im sat on my backside here having a nice
comfortable time... asking me how the cleanings going -''
``What cleaning?'' asked Harry.
``Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,'' said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen. ``No ones lived here for ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) old house-elf, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)s gone round the twist - hasnt cleaned anything in ages.''
``Sirius,'' said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention to the conversation, but
had been closely examining an empty goblet. ``This solid silver, mate?''
``Yes,'' said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. ``Finest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver,
embossed with the Black family crest.''
``Thatd come off, though,'' muttered Mundungus, polishing it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) cuff.
``Fred - George - NO, JUST CARRY THEM!'' Mrs. Weasley shrieked.
Harry, Sirius and Mundungus looked round and, a split second later, they had dived away from
the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of Butterbeer
and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air towards them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long
black burn on the wooden surface; the flagon of Butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents
everywhere; the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering
ominously, exactly where Siriuss right hand had been seconds before.
``FOR HEAVENS SAKE!'' screamed Mrs. Weasley. ``THERE WAS NO NEED - IVE HAD
ENOUGH OF THIS - JUST BECAUSE YOURE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW, YOU
DONT HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!''
``We were just trying to save a bit of time!'' said Fred, hurrying forward to wrench the bread knife out of the table. ``Sorry, Sirius, mate - didnt mean to -''
Harry and Sirius were both laughing; Mundungus, who had toppled backwards off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) chair, was
swearing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) feet; Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the
dresser, from where his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.
``Boys,'' Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, ``your mothers right, youre supposed to show a sense of responsibility now youve come of age -''
``None of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!'' Mrs. Weasley raged at the twins as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
slammed a fresh flagon of Butterbeer on to the table, and spilling almost as much again. ``Bill
didnt feel the need to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didnt charm everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) met! Percy -''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) stopped dead, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) breath with a frightened look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) husband, whose expression
was suddenly wooden.
``Lets eat,'' said Bill quickly.
``It looks wonderful, Molly,'' said Lupin, ladling stew on to a plate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) and handing it across
the table.
For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of
chairs as everyone settled down to their food. Then Mrs. Weasley turned to Sirius.
``Ive been meaning to tell you, Sirius, theres something trapped in that writing desk in the
drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just be a Boggart, but I thought
we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out.''
``Whatever you like,'' said Sirius indifferently.
``The curtains in there are full of Doxys, too,'' Mrs. Weasley went on. ``I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.''
``I look forward to it,'' said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) voice, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was not sure that
anyone else did.
Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) nose between
mouthfuls. Screwing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) eyes each time with the same pained expression she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) had worn back
in Harrys bedroom, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) nose swelled to a beak-like protuberance that resembled Snapes, shrank
to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril.
Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because Hermione and Ginny were soon
requesting their favorite noses.
``Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks.''
Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley was
grinning at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) from across the table.
Mr. Weasley, Bill and Lupin were having an intense discussion about goblins.
``Theyre not giving anything away yet,'' said Bill. ``I still cant work out whether or not they
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>)s back. Course, they might prefer not to take sides at all. Keep out of it.''
``Im sure theyd never go over to You-Know-Who,'' said Mr. Weasley, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) head.
``Theyve suffered losses too; remember that goblin family he (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) murdered last time, somewhere
near Nottingham?''
``I think it depends what theyre offered,'' said Lupin. ``And Im not talking about gold. If theyre
offered the freedoms weve been denying them for centuries theyre going to be tempted. Have
you still not had any luck with Ragnok, Bill?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,'' said Bill, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) hasnt stopped raging about the
Bagman business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>), you know -<div class="bookquote">''
A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bills words. Fred, George,
Ron and Mundungus were rolling around in their seats.
'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>... and then,'' choked Mundungus, tears running down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) face, ``and then, if youll believe it, e
says to me, e says, Ere, Dung, where did ya get all them toads from? Cos some son of a
Bludgers gone and nicked all mine! And I says, Nicked all your toads, Will, what next? So
youll be wanting some more, then? And if youll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle buys
all is own toads back orf me for a lot moren what e paid in the first place -''
``I dont think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank you very much,
Mundungus,'' said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Ron slumped forwards on to the table, howling with
laughter.
``Beg pardon, Molly,'' said Mundungus at once, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) eyes and winking at Harry. ``But, you
know, Will nicked em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I wasnt really doing nothing
wrong.''
``I dont know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have
missed a few crucial lessons,'' said Mrs. Weasley coldly.
Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of Butterbeer; George was hiccoughing. For
some reason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before getting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) feet and going
to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) godfather.
``Molly doesnt approve of Mundungus,'' said Sirius in an undertone.
``How come he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>)s in the Order?'' Harry said, very quietly.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>)s useful,'' Sirius muttered. ``Knows all the crooks - well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) would, seeing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>)s one
himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>)s also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) out of a tight spot once. It pays
to have someone like Dung around, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) hears things we dont. But Molly thinks inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) to
stay for dinner is going too far. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hasnt forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) for slipping off duty when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was
supposed to be tailing you.''
Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harrys jeans was
feeling uncomfortably tight -LRB-which was saying something as the jeans had once been Dudleys-RRB-.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) spoon there was a lull in the general conversation: Mr. Weasley was leaning
back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) chair, looking replete and relaxed; Tonks was yawning widely, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) nose now back to
normal; and Ginny who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling Butterbeer corks for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) to chase.
``Nearly time for bed, I think,'' said Mrs. Weasley with a yawn.
``Not just yet, Molly'' said Sirius, pushing away his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) empty plate and turning to look at Harry.
``You know, Im surprised at you. I thought the first thing youd do when you got here would be
to start asking questions about Voldemort.''
The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of
Dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A
frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemorts name. Lupin, who had been
about to take a sip of wine, lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) goblet slowly, looking wary.
``I did!'' said Harry indignantly. ``I asked Ron and Hermione but they said were not allowed in the Order, so -''
``And theyre quite right,'' said Mrs. Weasley. ``Youre too young.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was sitting bolt upright in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) fists clenched on its arms, every trace of drowsiness
gone.
``Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions?'' asked Sirius.
``Harrys been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s got the right to know whats been
happen--''
``Hang on!'' interrupted George loudly.
``How come Harry gets his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) questions answered?'' said Fred angrily.
``Weve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you havent told us a single stinking
thing!<div class="bookquote">'' said George.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Youre too young, youre not in the Order,'' said Fred in a high-pitched voice that sounded
uncannily like his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mothers. ``Harrys not even of age!''
``Its not my fault you havent been told what the Orders doing,'' said Sirius calmly, ``thats your
parents decision. Harry, on the other hand -''
``Its not down to you to decide whats good for Harry!'' said Mrs. Weasley sharply. The
expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) normally kind face looked dangerous. ``You havent forgotten what
Dumbledore said, I suppose?''
``Which bit?'' Sirius asked politely, but with the air of a man readying himself for a fight.
``The bit about not telling Harry more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) needs to know,'' said Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.
Ron, Hermione, Fred and Georges heads swiveled from Sirius to Mrs. Weasley as though they
were following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned Butterbeer corks,
watching the conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) mouth slightly open. Lupins eyes were fixed on Sirius.
``I dont intend to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) needs to know, Molly,'' said Sirius. ``But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was the
one who saw Voldemort come back'' -LRB-again, there was a collective shudder around the table at
the name-RRB- ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) has more right than most to -''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!'' said Mrs. Weasley. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s only fifteen and -''
``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s dealt with as much as most in the Order,'' said Sirius, ``and more than some.''
``No ones denying what he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s done!'' said Mrs. Weasley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) voice rising, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) fists trembling on
the arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) chair. ``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s still -''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s not a child!'' said Sirius impatiently.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s not an adult either!'' said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) cheeks. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s not James,
Sirius!''
``Im perfectly clear who he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is, thanks, Molly,'' said Sirius coldly.
``Im not sure you are!'' said Mrs. Weasley. ``Sometimes, the way you talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), its as
though you think youve got your best friend back!''
``Whats wrong with that?'' said Harry.
``Whats wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)!''
said Mrs. Weasley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) eyes still boring into Sirius. ``You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!''
``Meaning Im an irresponsible godfather?'' demanded Sirius, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) voice rising.
``Meaning you have been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding
you to stay at home and -''
``Well leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you please!'' said Sirius loudly.
``Arthur!'' said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) husband. ``Arthur, back me up!''
Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) glasses and cleaned them slowly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) robes,
not looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) wife. Only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) had replaced them carefully on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) nose did he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) reply.
``Dumbledore knows the position has changed, Molly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) accepts that Harry will have to be filled in, to a certain extent, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is staying at Headquarters.''
``Yes, but theres a difference between that and inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to ask whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) likes!''
``Personally,'' said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mrs. Weasley turned
quickly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), hopeful that finally she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was about to get an ally, ``I think it better that Harry gets
the facts - not all the facts, Molly, but the general picture - from us, rather than a garbled version
from... others.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) expression was mild, but Harry felt sure Lupin, at least, knew that some Extendable Ears had
survived Mrs. Weasleys purge.
``Well,'' said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, ``well... I can see Im going to be overruled. Ill just say this: Dumbledore must have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has Harrys best interests at heart -''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s not your son,'' said Sirius quietly.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s as good as,'' said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. ``Who else has he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s got me!''
``Yes,'' said Mrs. Weasley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) lip curling, ``the thing is, its been rather difficult for you to look
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) while youve been locked up in Azkaban, hasnt it?''
Sirius started to rise from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) chair.
``Molly, youre not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,'' said Lupin sharply.
``Sirius, sit down.''
Mrs. Weasleys lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) chair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) face white.
``I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,'' Lupin continued, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s old enough to decide for
himself.''
``I want to know whats been going on,'' Harry said at once.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not look at Mrs. Weasley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been touched by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) had said about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) being as
good as a son, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was also impatient with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) mollycoddling. Sirius was right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was not a
child.
``Very well,'' said Mrs. Weasley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) voice cracking. ``Ginny - Ron - Hermione - Fred - George - I want you out of this kitchen, now.''
There was instant uproar.
``Were of age!'' Fred and George bellowed together.
``If Harrys allowed, why cant I?'' shouted Ron.
``Mum, I want to hear!'' wailed Ginny.
``NO!'' shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) eyes over bright. ``I absolutely forbid -''
``Molly, you cant stop Fred and George,'' said Mr. Weasley wearily. ``They are of age.''
``Theyre still at school.''
``But theyre legally adults now,'' said Mr. Weasley, in the same tired voice.
Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face.
``I - oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron -''
``Harryll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!'' said Ron hotly. ``Wont - wont
you?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) added uncertainly, meeting Harrys eyes.
For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wouldnt tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a single word, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished
as they looked at each other.
``Course I will,'' Harry said.
Ron and Hermione beamed.
``Fine!'' shouted Mrs. Weasley. ``Fine! Ginny - BED!''
Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) raging and storming at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) mother all the way up
the stairs, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) reached the hall Mrs. Blacks ear-splitting shrieks were added to the din.
Lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only after he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) had returned, closing the
kitchen door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) seat at the table again, that Sirius spoke.
``Okay, Harry... what do you want to know?''
Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for the last month.
``Wheres Voldemort?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name. ``Whats
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doing? Ive been trying to watch the Muggle news, and there hasnt been anything that looks
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) yet, no funny deaths or anything.''
``Thats because there havent been any funny deaths yet,'' said Sirius, ``not as far as we know,
anyway... and we know quite a lot.''
``More than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thinks we do, anyway,'' said Lupin.
``How come he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s stopped killing people?'' Harry asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew Voldemort had murdered more
than once in the last year alone.
``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doesnt want to draw attention to himself,'' said Sirius. ``It would be dangerous for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) comeback didnt come off quite the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted it to, you see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) messed it up.''
``Or rather, you messed it up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),'' said Lupin, with a satisfied smile.
``How?'' Harry asked, perplexed.
``You werent supposed to survive!'' said Sirius. ``Nobody apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Death Eaters was
supposed to know he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d come back. But you survived to bear witness.''
``And the very last person he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted alerted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) return the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got back was
Dumbledore,'' said Lupin. ``And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once.''
``How has that helped?'' Harry asked.
``Are you kidding?'' said Bill incredulously. ``Dumbledore was the only one You-Know-Who was
ever scared of!''
``Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after
Voldemort returned,'' said Sirius.
``So, whats the Order been doing?'' said Harry, looking around at them all.
``Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort cant carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) plans,'' said Sirius.
``How dyou know what his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) plans are?'' Harry asked quickly.
``Dumbledores got a shrewd idea, said Lupin, <div class="bookquote">``and Dumbledores shrewd ideas normally turn
out to be accurate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So what does Dumbledore reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s planning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, firstly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wants to build up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) army again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``In the old days he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had huge
numbers at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) command: witches and wizards he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)d bullied or bewitched into following him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
faithful Death Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures. You heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) planning to recruit the
giants; well, theyll be just one of the groups he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s after. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s certainly not going to try and take
on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So youre trying to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) getting more followers?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Were doing our best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin.
<div class="bookquote">``How?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You-Know-Who
really has returned, to put them on their guard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill</b></font>)</div>said Bill. <div class="bookquote">``Its proving tricky, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because of the Ministrys attitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks. <div class="bookquote">``You saw Cornelius Fudge after You-Know-
Who came back, Harry. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hasnt shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) position at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s absolutely refusing to
believe its happened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry desperately. <div class="bookquote">``Whys he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) being so stupid? If Dumbledore -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, youve put your finger on the problem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley with a wry smile. <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fudge is frightened of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks sadly.
<div class="bookquote">``Frightened of Dumbledore?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry incredulously.
<div class="bookquote">``Frightened of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s up to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley. <div class="bookquote">``Fudge thinks Dumbledores plotting to
overthrow him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister for Magic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Dumbledore doesnt want -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) doesnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s never wanted the Ministers job, even though a
lot of people wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired. Fudge came to power
instead, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>)s never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, even though
Dumbledore never applied for the job.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledores much cleverer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) is - a much more powerful
wizard, and in the early days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) Ministry he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was forever asking Dumbledore for help and
advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``But it seems he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s become fond of power, and much more confident. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
loves being Minister for Magic and he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>)s managed to convince himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>)s the clever one
and Dumbledores simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) think that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry angrily. <div class="bookquote">``How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) think Dumbledore would just make it
all up - that Id make it all up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because accepting that Voldemorts back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasnt had to
cope with for nearly fourteen years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Fudge just cant bring himself to face
it. Its so much more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledores lying to destabilize him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You see the problem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``While the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from
Voldemort its hard to convince people he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s back, especially as they really dont want to believe
it in the first place. Whats more, the Ministrys leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what theyre calling Dumbledores rumor-mongering, so most of the wizarding
community are completely unaware any things happened, and that makes them easy targets for
the Death Eaters if theyre using the Imperius Curse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But youre telling people, arent you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, looking around at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill,
Mundungus, Lupin and Tonks. <div class="bookquote">``Youre letting people know he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s back?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They all smiled humorlessly.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, as everyone thinks Im a mad mass-murderer and the Ministrys put a ten thousand
Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius restlessly.
<div class="bookquote">``And Im not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Its an
occupational hazard of being a werewolf.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, <div class="bookquote">``and its very important for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Weve managed to convince a couple of people, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, <div class="bookquote">``Tonks here, for
one - she (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>)s too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on
our side is a huge advantage - Kingsley Shacklebolts been a real asset, too; he (<font color='blue'><b>Shacklebolt</b></font>)s in charge of the
hunt for Sirius, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But if none of you are putting the news out that Voldemorts back -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry began.
<div class="bookquote">``Who said none of us are putting the news out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``Why dyou think Dumbledores in
such trouble?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Theyre trying to discredit him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Didnt you see the Daily Prophet last week? They

Ministry wizards after he (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) made a speech announcing Voldemorts return. Theyve demoted him (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>)
from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot - thats the Wizard High Court - and theyre talking
about taking away his (<font color='blue'><b>Wizard</b></font>) Order of Merlin, First Class, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Dumbledore says he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) doesnt care what they do as long as they dont take him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) off the

<div class="bookquote">``Its no laughing matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley sharply. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) carries on defying the Ministry like

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But if Voldemorts trying to recruit more Death Eaters its bound to get out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s come back, isnt it?''

<div class="bookquote">``Voldemort doesnt march up to peoples houses and bang on their front doors, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said
Sirius. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tricks, jinxes and blackmails them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s well-practiced at operating in secret. In any
case, gathering followers is only one thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s interested in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s got other plans too, plans he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s concentrating on those for the moment.
``Whats he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) after apart from followers?'' Harry asked swiftly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Sirius and Lupin
exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius answered.
``Stuff he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can only get by stealth.''
When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, ``Like a weapon. Something he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didnt have
last time.''
``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was powerful before?''
``Yes.''
``Like what kind of weapon?'' said Harry. ``Something worse than the Avada Kedavra -?''
``Thats enough!''
Mrs. Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry hadnt noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) return from
taking Ginny upstairs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) arms were crossed and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) looked furious.
``I want you in bed, now. All of you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) added, looking around at Fred, George, Ron and
Hermione.
``You cant boss us -'' Fred began.
``Watch me,'' snarled Mrs. Weasley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was trembling slightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) looked at Sirius. ``Youve
given Harry plenty of information. Any more and you might just as well induct him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) into the
Order straightaway.''
``Why not?'' said Harry quickly. ``Ill join, I want to join, I want to fight.''
``No.''
It was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin.
``The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``Wizards who have left school,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
added, as Fred and George opened their mouths. ``There are dangers involved of which you can
have no idea, any of you... I think Mollys right, Sirius. Weve said enough.''
Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned imperiously to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) sons and
Hermione. One by one they stood up and Harry, recognizing defeat, followed suit.
CHAPTER SIX
The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black
Mrs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim.
``I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said as they reached the first landing, ``weve got a busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginnys asleep,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) added to Hermione, ``so try not to wake her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) up.''
``Asleep, yeah, right,'' said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade them goodnight and they
were climbing to the next floor. ``If Ginnys not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
everything they said downstairs then Im a Flobberworm...''
``All right, Ron, Harry,'' said Mrs. Weasley on the second landing, pointing them into their
bedroom. ``Off to bed with you.''
``Night,'' Harry and Ron said to the twins.
``Sleep tight,'' said Fred, winking.
Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The bedroom looked, if anything,
even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight. The blank picture on the wall was now
breathing very slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
pajamas, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses and climbed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chilly bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on
top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling
their wings restlessly.
``We cant let them out to hunt every night,'' Ron explained as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pulled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) maroon pajamas.
``Dumbledore doesnt want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks itll look
suspicious. Oh yeah... I forgot...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) crossed to the door and bolted it.
``Whatre you doing that for?''
``Kreacher,'' said Ron as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) turned off the light. ``First night I was here he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) came wandering in at
three in the morning. Trust me, you dont want to wake up and find him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) prowling around your
room. Anyway...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bed, settled down under the covers then turned to look at Harry
in the darkness; Harry could see his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy
window, ``what dyou reckon?''
Harry didnt need to ask what Ron meant.
``Well, they didnt tell us much we couldnt have guessed, did they?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, thinking of all that
had been said downstairs. ``I mean, all theyve really said is that the Orders trying to stop people
joining Vol--<div class="bookquote">''
There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron.
'' (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>--demort,'' said Harry firmly. ``When are you going to start using his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) name? Sirius and Lupin do.''
Ron ignored this last comment.
``Yeah, youre right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, ``we already knew nearly everything they told us, from using the
Extendable Ears. The only new bit was -''
Crack.
``OUCH!''
``Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mumll be back up he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) re.''
``You two just Apparated on my knees!''
``Yeah, well, its harder in the dark.''
Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from Rons bed. There was a
groan of bedsprings and Harrys mattress descended a few inches as George sat down near his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
feet.
``So, got there yet?'' said George eagerly.
``The weapon Sirius mentioned?'' said Harry.
``Let slip, more like,'' said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron. ``We didnt hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?''
``What dyou reckon it is?'' said Harry.
``Could be anything,'' said Fred.
``But there cant be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra Curse, can there?'' said Ron. ``Whats worse than death?''
``Maybe its something that can kill loads of people at once,'' suggested George.
``Maybe its some particularly painful way of killing people,'' said Ron fearfully.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,'' said Harry, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) doesnt need anything more
efficient than that.''
There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), were wondering what horrors this
weapon could perpetrate.
``So who dyou thinks got it now?'' asked George.
``I hope its our side,'' said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.
``If it is, Dumbledores probably keeping it,'' said Fred.
``Where?'' said Ron quickly. ``Hogwarts?''
``Bet it is!'' said George. ``Thats where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) hid the Sorcerers Stone.''
``A weapons going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!'' said Ron.
``Not necessarily'' said Fred.
``Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,'' said George. ``Look at Ginny.''
``What dyou mean?'' said Harry.
``Youve never been on the receiving end of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?''
``Shh!'' said Fred, half-rising from the bed. ``Listen!''
They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs.
``Mum,'' said George and without further ado there was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight
vanish from the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed. A few seconds later, they heard the floorboard creak outside their
door; Mrs. Weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talking.
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked again and they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)
heading upstairs to check on Fred and George.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) doesnt trust us at all, you know,'' said Ron regretfully.
Harry was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to
think about that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to
continue talking to Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and once
she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) had gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) distinctly heard others making their way upstairs... in fact, many-legged
creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid the Care of
Magical Creatures teacher was saying, ``Beauties, arn they, eh, Harry? Well be studyin weapons this term...'' and Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ducked...
The next thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was curled into a warm ball under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedclothes and Georges loud
voice was filling the room.
``Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) needs you in the drawing room,
there are loads more Doxys than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) thought and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)s found a nest of dead Puffskeins under the
sofa.''
Half an hour later Harry and Ron, who had dressed and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing
room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive green walls covered in dirty
tapestries. The carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the
long, moss green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees. It was
around these that Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred and George were grouped, all looking
rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth. Each of them was also
holding a large bottle of black liquid with anozzle at the end.
``Cover your faces and take a spray,'' Mrs. Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) saw
them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table. ``Its
Doxycide. Ive never seen an infestation this bad - what that house-elfs been doing for the last ten years -''
Hermiones face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry distinctly saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) throw a
reproachful look at Mrs. Weasley.
``Kreachers really old, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) probably couldnt manage -''
``Youd be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wants to, Hermione,'' said Sirius, who
had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. ``Ive just
been feeding Buckbeak,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) added, in reply to Harry s enquiring look. ``I keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) upstairs in my
mothers bedroom. Anyway... this writing desk...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dropped the bag of rats into an armchair, then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which,
Harry now noticed for the first time, was shaking slightly.
``Well, Molly, Im pretty sure this is a Boggart,'' said Sirius, peering through the keyhole, ``but
perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out - knowing my mother, it
could be something much worse.''
``Right you are, Sirius,'' said Mrs. Weasley.
They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry quite plainly that neither
had forgotten their disagreement of the night before.
A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by the cacophony of screams
and wails that had been triggered the previous night by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand.
``I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!'' said Sirius exasperatedly, hurrying out of the room.
They heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) thundering down the stairs as Mrs. Blacks screeches echoed up through the
house once more:
``Stains, of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children of filth''
``Close the door, please, Harry,'' said Mrs. Weasley.
Harry took as much time as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dared to close the drawing-room door; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to listen to what
was going on downstairs. Sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) mothers
portrait because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had stopped screaming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the
clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a deep voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) recognized as Kingsley
Shacklebolts saying, ``Hestias just relieved me, so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)s got Moodys Cloak now, thought Id
leave a report for Dumbledore...''
Feeling Mrs. Weasleys eyes on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) head, Harry regretfully closed the drawing-room
door and rejoined the Doxy party.
Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on Doxys in Gilderoy Lockharts Guide to
Household Pests, which was lying open on the sofa.
``Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because Doxys bite and their teeth are poisonous. Ive got a bottle of antidote here, but Id rather nobody needed it.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains and beckoned them all
forward.
``When I say the word, start spraying immediately,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said. ``Theyll come flying out at us, I
expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyze them. When theyre immobilized,
just throw them in this bucket.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) stepped carefully out of their line of fire, and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) own spray.
``All right - squirt!''
Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully-grown Doxy came soaring out of a
fold in the material, shiny beetle-like wings whirring, tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairy-like
body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury. Harry caught it full
in the face with a blast of Doxycide. It froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud hunk, on
to the worn carpet below. Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket.
``Fred, what are you doing?'' said Mrs. Weasley sharply. ``Spray that at once and throw it away!''
Harry looked round. Fred was holding a struggling Doxy between his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forefinger and thumb.
``Right-o, Fred said brightly, spraying the Doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the
moment Mrs. Weasleys back was turned he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pocketed it with a wink.
<div class="bookquote">``We want to experiment with Doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>George told Harry under his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breath.
Deftly spraying two Doxys at once as they soared straight for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nose, Harry moved closer to
George and muttered out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth, <div class="bookquote">``What are Skiving Snackboxes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Range of sweets to make you ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs. Weasleys
back. <div class="bookquote">``Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred
and I have been developing them this summer. Theyre double-ended, color-coded chews. If
you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment youve been rushed out of
the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own
choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom. Thats
what were putting in the adverts, anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs.
Weasleys line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray Doxys from the floor and adding
them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``But they still need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit
of trouble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Testers?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies - we both tried the
Nosebleed Nougat -''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mum thought wed been dueling,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.
<div class="bookquote">``Joke shop still on, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spray.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, we havent had a chance to get premises yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) voice even lower as
Mrs. Weasley mopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) brow with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) scarf before returning to the attack, <div class="bookquote">``so were running it
as a mail-order service at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All thanks to you, mate,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``But dont worry... Mum hasnt got a clue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) wont read the Daily Prophet any more, cause of it telling lies about you and Dumbledore.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry grinned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand Galleons prize money he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was still glad to know that his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs.
Weasley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) did not think running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) sons.
The de-Doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was past midday when Mrs.
Weasley finally removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) protective scarf, sank into a sagging armchair and sprang up again
with a cry of disgust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer buzzing;
they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying. At the foot of them unconscious Doxys
lay crammed in the bucket beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now
sniffing and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks.
<div class="bookquote">``I think well tackle those after lunch.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets
standing on either side of the mantelpiece. They were crammed with an odd assortment of
objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver
boxes inscribed with languages Harry could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate
crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was quite sure was blood.
The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs. Weasley.
<div class="bookquote">``Stay here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs. Blacks screeches started up
again from down below. <div class="bookquote">``Ill bring up some sandwiches.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) left the room, closing the door carefully behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>). At once, everyone dashed over to the
window to look down on the doorstep. They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a
stack of precariously balanced cauldrons.
<div class="bookquote">``Mundungus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Whats he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) brought all those cauldrons for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Isnt that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was doing the
night he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy cauldrons?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, youre right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundungus heaved his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) cauldrons
through it and disappeared from view. <div class="bookquote">``Blimey, Mum wont like that...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening closely. Mrs. Blacks screaming
had stopped.
<div class="bookquote">``Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred muttered, frowning with concentration. <div class="bookquote">``Cant hear properly... dyou reckon we can risk the Extendable Ears?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Might be worth it,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``I could sneak up stairs and get a pair -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered
Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of them could hear exactly what Mrs. Weasley was
shouting at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, with a satisfied smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs. Weasleys voice to permeate the room better, <div class="bookquote">``it
makes such a nice change.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVENT GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY
ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The idiots are letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) get into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) stride,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Youve got to head her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) off early otherwise she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)s been
dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sneaked off when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was supposed to be
following you, Harry - and there goes Siriuss mum again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Weasleys voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall.
George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could do so, a house-elf edged
into the room.
Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked. It
looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and, though it was bald like all
house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes
were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike.
The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it
shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, towards the far end of the room, all the while
muttering under its breath in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrogs.
<div class="bookquote">''... smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)s no better, nasty old blood traitor with her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Kreacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap.
The house-elf froze in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) tracks, stopped muttering, and gave a very pronounced and very
unconvincing start of surprise.
<div class="bookquote">``Kreacher did not see young master,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, turning around and bowing to Fred. Still facing the
carpet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) added, perfectly audibly, <div class="bookquote">``Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sorry?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``Didnt catch that last bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Kreacher said nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the elf</b></font>)</div>said the elf, with a second bow to George, adding in a clear undertone,
<div class="bookquote">``and theres its twin, unnatural little beasts they are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>Harry didnt know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up, eyeing them all
malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) continued to mutter.
<div class="bookquote">''... and theres the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh, if my mistress knew, oh, how

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is Harry, Kreacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione tentatively. <div class="bookquote">``Harry Potter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kreacher</b></font>)</div>Kreachers pale eyes widened and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) muttered faster and more furiously than ever.
<div class="bookquote">``The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is my friend, if Kreachers mistress saw him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont call her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) a Mudblood!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont kid yourself, Hermione, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) knows exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)s saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Fred, eyeing Kreacher
with great dislike.
Kreacher was still muttering, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) eyes on Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see t he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) scar, it must be true, thats the boy who
stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) did it -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont we all, Kreacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you want, anyway?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>George asked.
Kreachers huge eyes darted towards George.
<div class="bookquote">``Kreacher is cleaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said evasively.
<div class="bookquote">``A likely story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said a voice behind Harry.
Sirius had come back; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in the hall had
abated; perhaps Mrs. Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen.
At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
snoutlike nose on the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Stand up straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Now, what are you up to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Kreacher is cleaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the elf</b></font>)</div>the elf repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Kreacher lives to serve the Noble House of Black -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And its getting blacker every day, its filthy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``Master always liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) little joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kreacher</b></font>)</div>said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an
undertone, <div class="bookquote">``Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) mothers heart -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kreacher</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My mother didnt have a heart, Kreacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kreacher</b></font>)</div>snapped Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kept herself alive out of pure
spite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kreacher</b></font>)</div>Kreacher bowed again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Whatever Master says,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) muttered furiously. <div class="bookquote">``Master is not fit to wipe slime from his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) mothers boots, oh, my poor mistress, what would she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) say if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) saw Kreacher serving him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>), how she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>), what a disappointment he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I asked you what you were up to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius coldly. <div class="bookquote">``Every time you show up pretending to be
cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we cant throw it out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Masters house,''  (<font color='red'><b>the elf</b></font>)</div>said the elf, then muttered very fast, <div class="bookquote">``Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries its been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it -''
 (<font color='red'><b>the elf</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thought it might be that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the elf</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>)ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I dont doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go away, Kreacher.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kreacher</b></font>)</div>It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the look he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) gave Sirius
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) shuffled out past him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was full of deepest loathing and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) muttered all the way out of the
room.
<div class="bookquote">''- comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh, my poor mistress, what would she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
say if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) saw the house now, scum living in it, her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) treasures thrown out, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) swore he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was no
son of hers and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s back, they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s a murderer too -''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius irritably as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) slammed the door shut on
the elf.
<div class="bookquote">``Sirius, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>)s not right in the head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione pleaded, <div class="bookquote">``I dont think he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) realizes we can hear him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>)s been alone too long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, <div class="bookquote">``taking mad orders from my mothers portrait and talking to himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was always a foul little -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you could just set him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) free,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Hermione hopefully, <div class="bookquote">``maybe -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We cant set him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) free, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) knows too much about the Order''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Sirius curtly. <div class="bookquote">``And anyway, the shock would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>). You suggest to him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) leaves this house, see how he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) takes it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the
length of the wall. Harry and the others followed.
The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as though Doxys had gnawed it in
places. Nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly
enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back -LRB-as far as Harry could tell-RRB- to the
Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:
The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black Toujours pur
<div class="bookquote">``Youre not on here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Black</b></font>)</div>said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the tree closely.
<div class="bookquote">``I used to be there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. <div class="bookquote">``My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home - Kreachers quite fond of muttering the story under his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) breath.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You ran away from home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When I was about sixteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``Id had enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where did you go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>asked Harry, staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Your dads place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dads in the school holidays, and when I was seventeen I got a place of my own. My Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold - he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>)s been wiped off here, too, thats probably why - anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potters for Sunday lunch, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But... why did you...?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Leave?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Sirius smiled bitterly and ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) fingers through his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) long, unkempt hair. <div class="bookquote">``Because I
hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a
Black made you practically royal... my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them... thats him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name Regulus Black. A date of death
-LRB-some fifteen years previously-RRB- followed the date of birth.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was younger than me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, <div class="bookquote">``and a much better son, as I was constantly reminded.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) died,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``Stupid idiot... he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) joined the Death Eaters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Youre kidding!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Harry, havent you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family
were?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius testily.
<div class="bookquote">``Were - were your parents Death Eaters as well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the
purification of the wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and having pure-bloods in charge.
They werent alone, either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) true
colors, who thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had the right idea about things... they got cold feet when they saw what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right
little hero for joining up at first.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) killed by an Auror?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked tentatively.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemorts orders, more likely; I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) died, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) got in so far, then panicked about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you dont just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. Its a lifetime of service or death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lunch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Weasleys</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasleys voice.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wand high in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and
cake on its tip. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was very red in the face and still looked angry. The others moved over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>),
eager for some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry.
<div class="bookquote">``I havent looked at this for years. Theres Phineas Nigellus... my great-great-grandfather, see?... least popular Headmaster Hogwarts ever had... and Araminta Mehflua... cousin of my
mothers... tried to force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal... and dear Aunt
Elladora... she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) started the family tradition of beheading house-elves when they got too old to
carry tea trays... of course, any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were
disowned. I see Tonks isnt on here. Maybe thats why Kreacher wont take orders from her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) - he (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>)s supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You and Tonks are related?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, surprised.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeah, her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) mother Andromeda was my favorite cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, examining the tapestry
closely. <div class="bookquote">``No, Andromedas not on here either, look -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa.
<div class="bookquote">``Andromedas sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages,
but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry, however, did not
laugh; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromedas burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy and a single vertical gold line
from their names led to the name Draco.
<div class="bookquote">``Youre related to the Malfoys!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The pure-blood families are all interrelated,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``If youre only going to let your sons
and daughters marry pure-bloods your choice is very limited; there are hardly any of us left.
Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthurs something like my second cousin once
removed. But theres no point looking for them on here - if ever a family was a bunch of blood
traitors its the Weasleys.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromedas burn: Bellatrix Black, which
was connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange.
<div class="bookquote">``Lestrange...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) memory; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldnt think where, though it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) an odd, creeping
sensation in the pit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach.
<div class="bookquote">``Theyre in Azkaban,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius shortly.
Harry looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) curiously.
<div class="bookquote">``Bellatrix and her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch junior,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, in the same brusque voice. <div class="bookquote">``Rodolphuss brother Rabastan was with them, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Then Harry remembered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledores Pensieve, the
strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavylidded eyes, who had stood at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trial and proclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continuing allegiance to Lord
Voldemort, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pride that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had tried to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) downfall and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would one day be rewarded for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loyalty.
<div class="bookquote">``You never said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was your -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does it matter if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)s my cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>snapped Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``As far as Im concerned, theyre not my
family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)s certainly not my family. I havent seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) since I was your age, unless you count a
glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) coming into Azkaban. Dyou think Im proud of having a relative like her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly, <div class="bookquote">``I didnt mean - I was just surprised, thats all -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It doesnt matter, dont apologize,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Sirius mumbled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) turned away from the tapestry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) hands deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) pockets. <div class="bookquote">``I dont like being back here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said, staring across the drawing room. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought Id be stuck in this house again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry understood completely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would feel, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was grown up and thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was free of the place for ever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive.
<div class="bookquote">``Its ideal for Headquarters, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Sirius said. <div class="bookquote">``My father put every security measure known to wizard kind on it when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lived here. Its unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call - as if theyd ever have wanted to - and now Dumbledores added his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) protection, youd be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore is Secret Keeper for the Order, you know - nobody can find Headquarters unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) tells them personally where it is - that note Moody showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore...''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Sirius gave a short, bark-like laugh. <div class="bookquote">``If my parents could see the use their house was being put to now... well, my mothers portrait should give you some idea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) scowled for a moment, then sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``I wouldnt mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful. Ive asked
Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing - as Snuffles, obviously - so I can give you
a bit of moral support, what dyou think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry felt as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not thought about the
hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) liked best, and hearing everything that was going on, it had completely flown his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind. At
Siriuss words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) stared at Hermione and
the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) would feel if they went back
to Hogwarts without him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Dont worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius had been watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Im
sure theyll clear you, theres definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about
being allowed to use magic to save your own life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But if they do expel me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quietly, <div class="bookquote">``can I come back here and live with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Sirius smiled sadly.
<div class="bookquote">``Well see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Id feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didnt have to go back to the Dursleys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry
pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``They must be bad if you prefer this place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius gloomily.
<div class="bookquote">``Hurry up, you two, or there wont be any food left,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Weasley called.
Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) and Harry went to join
the others.
Harry tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass-fronted cabinets
that afternoon. Fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), it was a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of
the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite
from a silver snuffbox; within seconds his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty
covering like a tough brown glove.
<div class="bookquote">``Its okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wand and
restoring its skin to normal, <div class="bookquote">``must be Wartcap powder in there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets;
Harry saw George wrap his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) already Doxy-filled pocket.
They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of
tweezers, which scuttled up Harrys arm like a spider when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) picked it up, and attempted to
puncture his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skin. Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Natures Nobility: A
Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune
when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny
had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of
ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to
Siriuss grandfather for services to the Ministry.
<div class="bookquote">``It means he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) gave them a load of gold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius contemptuously, throwing the medal into the
rubbish sack.
Several times Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) at it. When Sirius wrested a large
golden ring bearing the Black crest from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) grip, Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and
left the room sobbing under his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never heard before.
<div class="bookquote">``It was my fathers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack. <div class="bookquote">``Kreacher wasnt quite as devoted to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as to my mother, but I still caught him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) snogging a pair of my fathers old trousers last week.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days. The drawing room took
three days to decontaminate. Finally, the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the
Black family tree, which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the rattling
writing desk. Moody had not dropped by Headquarters yet, so they could not be sure what was
inside it.
They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found
spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser -LRB-Ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of
tea and did not return for an hour and a half-RRB-. The china, which bore the Black crest and motto,
was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old
photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass
covering them smashed.
Snape might refer to their work as cleaning, but in Harrys opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept appearing wherever they were congregated, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttering becoming more and more offensive as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) attempted to remove anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) with a watery stare and said, <div class="bookquote">``Master must do as Master wishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>before turning away and muttering very loudly, <div class="bookquote">``but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum...''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>At which Sirius, ignoring Hermiones protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) loincloth and
threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) bodily from the room.
The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Siriuss mother to start shrieking
again, and for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned
very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before
Mrs. Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house several times
more, though to Harrys relief they never came face to face; Harry also caught sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
Transfiguration teacher Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) also seemed too busy to linger. Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help. Tonks
joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an
upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long
periods to do mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had
developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passers-by. Mundungus redeemed
himself slightly in Mrs. Weasleys eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that
had tried to strangle him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) removed them from their wardrobe.
Despite the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about corridors and locked
doors that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) scar prickle, Harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer.
As long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was busy he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dropped
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought
of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Fear jabbed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides like needles as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wondered what was going to happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was expelled. The idea was so terrible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) often saw them
whispering together and casting anxious looks in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) direction, followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) lead in not
mentioning it. Sometimes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could not prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) imagination showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) a faceless Ministry
official who was snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wand in two and ordering him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back to the Dursleys... but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
would not go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was determined on that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) would come back here to Grimmauld Place and
live with Sirius.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) felt as though a brick had dropped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) stomach when Mrs. Weasley turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) during
dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``Ive ironed your best clothes for tomorrow
morning, Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight, too. A good first impression can work
wonders.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). Harry
nodded and tried to keep eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chops, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth had become so dry he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not chew.
<div class="bookquote">``How am I getting there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked Mrs. Weasley, trying to sound unconcerned.
<div class="bookquote">``Arthurs taking you to work with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthurs</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasley gently.
Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.
<div class="bookquote">``You can wait in my office until its time for the hearing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said.
Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could ask the question, Mrs. Weasley had answered it.
<div class="bookquote">``Professor Dumbledore doesnt think its a good idea for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``think he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius through clenched teeth.
Mrs. Weasley pursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) lips.
<div class="bookquote">``When did Dumbledore tell you that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said, staring at Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) came last night, when you were in bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley.
Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) fork. Harry lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) plate. The
thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) hearing and not asked to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) feel, if it were possible, even worse.
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Ministry of Magic
Harry awoke at half past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had
yelled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) ear. For a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing
filled every tiny particle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) brain, then, unable to bear it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) leapt out of bed and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) bed.
Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered.
Ron was lying sprawled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth wide open, fast asleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) did not stir as
Harry crossed the room, stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Trying not to think of the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow
students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreachers
ancestors, and down into the kitchen.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had expected it to be empty, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard the soft rumble of voices
on the other side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pushed it open and saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin and Tonks
sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>). All were fully dressed except Mrs.
Weasley, who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) leapt to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) feet the moment
Harry entered.
<div class="bookquote">``Breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) pulled out her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) wand and hurried over to the fire.
<div class="bookquote">``M - m - morning, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>yawned Tonks. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hair was blonde and curly this morning. <div class="bookquote">``Sleep all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Ive b - b - been up all night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, with another shuddering yawn. <div class="bookquote">``Come and sit down...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you want, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Weasley called. <div class="bookquote">``Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and
eggs? Toast?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just - just toast, thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, <div class="bookquote">``What were you saying about Scrimgeour?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh... yeah... well, we need to be a bit more careful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s been asking Kingsley and me funny
questions...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry felt vaguely grateful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not required to join in the conversation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides were
squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) other side and started
fussing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulders.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) wouldnt.
<div class="bookquote">''... and Ill have to tell Dumbledore I cant do night duty tomorrow, Im just too tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Tonks
finished, yawning hugely again.
<div class="bookquote">``Ill cover for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley. <div class="bookquote">``Im okay, Ive got a report to finish anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizards robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber
jacket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) turned from Tonks to Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``How are you feeling?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry shrugged.
<div class="bookquote">``Itll all be over soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley said bracingly. <div class="bookquote">``In a few hours time youll be cleared.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said nothing.
<div class="bookquote">``The hearings on my floor, in Amelia Boness office. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>)s Head of the Department of Magical
Law Enforcement, and the one wholl be questioning you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>)s fair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>)ll hear you out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont lose your temper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``Be polite and stick to the facts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry nodded again.
<div class="bookquote">``The laws on your side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Something very cold trickled down the back of Harrys neck; for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought someone
was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair with a wet comb. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) pressed hard on the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Doesnt it ever lie flat?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said desperately.
Harry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head.
Mr. Weasley checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) watch and looked up at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``I think well go now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Were a bit early but I think youll be better off at the Ministry
than hanging around here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry automatically, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) toast and getting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet.
<div class="bookquote">``Youll be all right, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Tonks, patting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) on the arm.
<div class="bookquote">``Good luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Im sure it will be fine.'' 
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And if its not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius grimly <div class="bookquote">``Ill see to Amelia Bones for you...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Weve all got our fingers crossed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Well... see you later then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear Siriuss mother grunting in
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sleep behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) curtains. Mr. Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold,
grey dawn.
<div class="bookquote">``You dont normally walk to work, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), as they set off briskly around the
square.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I usually Apparate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, <div class="bookquote">``but obviously you cant, and I think its best we
arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion... makes a better impression, given what youre
being disciplined for...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hand inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand. The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable
little underground station they found it already full of early-morning commuters. As ever when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr. Weasley
was hard put to contain his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) enthusiasm.
<div class="bookquote">``Simply fabulous,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. <div class="bookquote">``Wonderfully
ingenious.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Theyre out of order,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, pointing at the sign.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, but even so...''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, beaming at them fondly
They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard -LRB-Harry handled the transaction, as
Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle money-RRB- and five minutes later they were boarding
an underground train that rattled them off towards the center of London. Mr. Weasley kept
anxiously checking and re-checking the Underground Map above the windows.
<div class="bookquote">``Four more stops, Harry... Three stops left now... Two stops to go, Harry...''
 (<font color='red'><b>men women</b></font>)</div>They got off at a station in the very heart of London, and were swept from the train in a tide of
besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up the escalator they went, through the ticket
barrier -LRB-Mr. Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) ticket-RRB-, and emerged on to a
broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings and already full of traffic.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are we?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought
they had got off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasleys continual references to the map; but
a second later he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah yes... this way, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) down a side road.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle
perspective. As a matter of fact, Ive never even used the visitors entrance before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The further they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they
reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub and an overflowing
dumpster. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic.
<div class="bookquote">``Here we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which was
missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffitied wall. <div class="bookquote">``After you, Harry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) opened the telephone-box door.
Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr. Weasley folded himself in
beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone
apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off.
Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no, Im sure its fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver above his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) head and peering at
the dial. <div class="bookquote">``Lets see... six...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) dialed the number, <div class="bookquote">``two... four... and another four... and
another two...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone
box, not from the receiver in Mr. Weasleys hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an
invisible woman were standing right beside them.
<div class="bookquote">``Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Er...''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether or not he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) should talk into the receiver. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) ear, <div class="bookquote">``Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle
Artifacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said the cool female voice. <div class="bookquote">``Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front
of your robes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where
returned coins usually appeared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) picked it up: it was a square silver badge with Harry Potter,
Disciplinary Hearing on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) pinned it to the front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) T-shirt as the female voice spoke
again.
<div class="bookquote">``Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for
registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry
watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the
telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see nothing at all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After
about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet
and, widening, rose up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body, until it hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the face and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to blink to stop his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes
from watering.
<div class="bookquote">``The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the womans voice.
The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out of it, followed by
Harry, whose mouth had fallen open.
They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark
wood floor. The peacock blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving
and changing like some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side were paneled in
shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or
wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh. On the right-hand
side, short queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart.
Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in
the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) wand
pointing straight up in the air. Grouped around him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin
and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard. Glittering
jets of water were flying from the ends of their wands, the point of the centaurs arrow, the tip of
the goblins hat and each of the house-elfs ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was
added to the pops and cracks of the Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of
witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode towards a
set of golden gates at the far end of the hall.
<div class="bookquote">``This way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley.
They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry workers, some of whom were
carrying tottering piles of parchment, others battered briefcases; still others were reading the
Daily Prophet while they walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and
bronze Knuts glinting up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from the bottom of the pool. A small smudged sign beside it
read:
ALL PROCEEDS FROM THE FOUNTAIN OF MAGICAL BRETHREN WILL BE GIVEN
TO ST. MUNGOS HOSPITAL FOR MAGICAL MALADIES AND INJURIES.
If Im not expelled from Hogwarts, Ill put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking
desperately.
<div class="bookquote">``Over here, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees
heading for the golden gates. Seated at a desk to the left, beneath a sign saying Security, a badly shaven wizard in peacock blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) Daily
Prophet.
<div class="bookquote">``Im escorting a visitor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, gesturing towards Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Step over here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>said the wizard in a bored voice.
Harry walked closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car
aerial, and passed it up and down Harrys front and back.
<div class="bookquote">``Wand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the security wizard</b></font>)</div>grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden instrument and holding
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand.
Harry produced his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand. The wizard dropped it on to a strange brass instrument, which looked
something like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of
parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing
on it.
<div class="bookquote">``Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That correct?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``I keep this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike. <div class="bookquote">``You get this back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added, thrusting the wand at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hang on...''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>said the wizard slowly.
His (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) eyes had darted from the silver visitors badge on Harrys chest to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Eric,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the shoulder he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) steered him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden
gates.
Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall
beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley
joined the crowd around one of them. Nearby, stood a big bearded wizard holding a large
cardboard box which was emitting rasping noises.
<div class="bookquote">``All right, Arthur?''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley.
<div class="bookquote">``Whatve you got there, Bob?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the box.
<div class="bookquote">``Were not sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>said the wizard seriously. <div class="bookquote">``We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it
started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back
and Harry and Mr. Weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and Harry found
himself jammed against the back wall. Several witches and wizards were looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
curiously; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet to avoid catching anyones eye, flattening his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fringe as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did so.
The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling, while the same
cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again.
<div class="bookquote">``Level Seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish
Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club and Ludicrous Patents Office.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The lift doors opened. Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with various posters of
Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls. One of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying
an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor.
The doors closed, the lift juddered upwards again and the womans voice announced:
<div class="bookquote">``Level Six, Department of Magical Transportation, incorporating the Floo Network Authority,
Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office and Apparation Test Center.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out; at the same time,
several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly
around above his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head; they were a pale violet color and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see Ministry of Magic
stamped along the edge of their wings.
<div class="bookquote">``Just inter-departmental memos,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley muttered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We used to use owls, but the
mess was unbelievable... droppings all over the desks...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>As they clattered upwards again the memos flapped around the lamp swaying from the lifts
ceiling.
<div class="bookquote">``Level Five, Department of International Magical Co -operation, incorporating the International
Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law and the International
Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the witches wizards</b></font>)</div>When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and
wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp flickered and
flashed overhead as they darted around it.
<div class="bookquote">``Level Four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating
Beast, Being and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office and Pest Advisory Bureau.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Scuse,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet again.
<div class="bookquote">``Level Three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental
Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry and a witch who was reading an
extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the floor. The remaining memos
continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again, then the doors opened and
the voice made its announcement.
<div class="bookquote">``Level Two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic
Office, Auror Headquarters and Wizengamot Administration Services.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is us, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor
lined with doors. <div class="bookquote">``My office is on the other side o f the floor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Weasley''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming,
<div class="bookquote">``arent we still underground?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley. <div class="bookquote">``Those are enchanted windows. Magical Maintenance decide
what weather well get every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling
for a pay rise... Just round here, Harry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open
area divided into cubicles, which was buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in
and out of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read: Auror
Headquarters.
Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered their
cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families,
to posters of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarlet-robed
man with a ponytail longer than Bills was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) boots up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) desk, dictating a report
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) quill. A little further along, a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of
her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt.
<div class="bookquote">``Morning, Weasley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kingsley/Kingsley Shacklebolt/Shacklebolt</b></font>)</div>said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. <div class="bookquote">``Ive been wanting a word
with you, have you got a second?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if it really is a second,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, <div class="bookquote">``Im in rather a hurry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>They were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth to
say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and
into the very last cubicle.
Harry received a slight shock; blinking down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from every direction was Siriuss face.
Newspaper cuttings and old photographs - even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters
wedding -papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red
pins were glowing like jewels.
<div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kingsley/Kingsley Shacklebolt/Shacklebolt</b></font>)</div>said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I
need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve
months. Weve received information that Black might still be using his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) old motorcycle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kingsley/Kingsley Shacklebolt/Shacklebolt</b></font>)</div>Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) the magazine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
might find it interesting.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) said in normal tones, <div class="bookquote">``And dont take too long, Weasley, the
delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you had read my report you would know that the term is firearms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley coolly.
<div class="bookquote">``And Im afraid youll have to wait for information on motorcycles; were extremely busy at the
moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) voice and said, <div class="bookquote">``If you can get away before seven, Mollys making
meatballs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) beckoned to Harry and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out of Kingsleys cubicle, through a second set of oak doors,
into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and
distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar,
revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading:
Misuse of Muggle Artifacts.
Mr. Weasleys dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks
had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the
overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The
little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasleys obsessions: several posters of cars,
including one of a dismantled engine; two illustrations of postboxes he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) seemed to have cut out of
Muggle childrens books; and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.
Sitting on top of Mr. Weasleys overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a
disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A
photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to
have walked out of it.
<div class="bookquote">``We havent got a window,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) bomber jacket and
placing it on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``Weve asked, but they dont seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesnt look as if Perkins is in yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkinss desk while Mr. Weasley riffled through
the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, grinning, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its
midst, <div class="bookquote">``yes...''  (<font color='red'><b>midst</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) flicked through it. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>)s right, Im sure Sirus will find that very amusing - oh dear, whats this now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccoughing
toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and read it aloud.
<div class="bookquote">''Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately.
This is getting ridiculous...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A regurgitating toilet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anti-Muggle pranksters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, frowning. <div class="bookquote">``We had two last week, one in
Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything
disappearing - well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those - pumbles, I think
theyre called - you know, the ones who mend pipes and things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Plumbers?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly, yes, but of course theyre flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoevers doing it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will it be Aurors who catch them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, itll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol - ah,
Harry, this is Perkins.''
 (<font color='red'><b>A wizard</b></font>)</div>A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room, panting.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Arthur!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said desperately, without looking at Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Thank goodness, I didnt know
what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not. Ive just sent an owl to your home
but youve obviously missed it - an urgent message came ten minutes ago -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know about the regurgitating toilet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no, its not the toilet, its the Potter boys hearing - theyve changed the time and venue - it
starts at eight oclock now and its down in old Courtroom Ten -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Down in old - but they told me - Merlins beard!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) watch, let out a yelp and leapt from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) chair.
<div class="bookquote">``Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Perkins</b></font>)</div>Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley left the office at a run, Harry
close on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heels.
<div class="bookquote">``Why have they changed the time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said breathlessly, as they hurtled past the Auror
cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d
left all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides back at Perkinss desk.
<div class="bookquote">``Ive no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if youd missed it, it would have been
catastrophic!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button.
<div class="bookquote">``Come ON!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped Mr. Weasley cursed
furiously and pummeled the number nine button.
<div class="bookquote">``Those courtrooms havent been used in years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley angrily. <div class="bookquote">``I cant think why
theyre doing it down there - unless - but no -''
 (<font color='red'><b>A witch</b></font>)</div>A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment, and Mr. Weasley did
not elaborate.
<div class="bookquote">``The Atrium,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open, showing Harry a
distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow skinned wizard with a very mournful face got in.
<div class="bookquote">``Morning, Arthur,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend. <div class="bookquote">``Dont often see you down here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Urgent business, Bode,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) feet and
throwing anxious looks over at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. <div class="bookquote">``Of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) unfaltering gaze did not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feel any
more comfortable.
<div class="bookquote">``Department of Mysteries,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the cool female voice, and left it at that.
<div class="bookquote">``Quick, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that
was quite different from those above. The walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors
apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected them to go
through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) by the arm and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) to the left, where
there was an opening leading to a flight of steps.
<div class="bookquote">``Down here, down here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at a time. <div class="bookquote">``The lift doesnt even
come down this far... why theyre doing it down there I...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor, which bore a great
resemblance to the one that led to Snapes dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and
torches in brackets. The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and
keyholes.
<div class="bookquote">``Courtroom... Ten... I think... were nearly... yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and
slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) chest.
<div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) panted, pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) thumb at the door. <div class="bookquote">``Get in there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Arent - arent you coming with -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Im not allowed. Good luck!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harrys heart was beating a violent tattoo against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Adams apple. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swallowed hard, turned
the heavy iron door handle and stepped inside the courtroom.
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Hearing
Harry gasped; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not help himself. The large dungeon he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had entered was horribly
familiar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not only seen it before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been here before. This was the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
visited inside Dumbledores Pensieve, the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had watched the Lestranges sentenced
to life imprisonment in Azkaban.
The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty benches rose on either side of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking
in low voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell.
A cold male voice rang across the courtroom.
<div class="bookquote">``Youre late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry nervously <div class="bookquote">``I -- I didnt know the time had been changed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is not the Wizengamots fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the voice. <div class="bookquote">``An owl was sent to you this morning. Take your seat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gaze to the chair in the center of the room, the arms of which were covered in
chains. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) footsteps
echoed loudly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked across the stone floor. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat gingerly on the edge of the chair
the chains clinked threateningly, but did not bind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Feeling rather sick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up at the
people seated at the bench above.
There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see, wearing plum-colored robes with an
elaborately worked silver W on the left-hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), some with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity.
In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic. Fudge was a
portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though today he (<font color='blue'><b>bowler</b></font>) had dispensed with it; he (<font color='blue'><b>bowler</b></font>)
had dispensed, too, with the indulgent smile he (<font color='blue'><b>bowler</b></font>) had once worn when he (<font color='blue'><b>bowler</b></font>) spoke to Harry. A broad,
square-jawed witch with very short grey hair sat on Fudges left; she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) wore a monocle and looked
forbidding. On Fudges right was another witch, but she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) was sitting so far back on the bench that
her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) face was in shadow.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge. <div class="bookquote">``The accused being present - finally - let us begin. Are you ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
called down the row.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said an eager voice Harry knew. Rons brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the
front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but none
came. Percys eyes, behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) parchment, a quill poised
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began
taking notes at once, ``into offences committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at
number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
``Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister for Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the
Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley -''
``Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,'' said a quiet voice from
behind Harry, who turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head so fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cricked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck.
Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a
perfectly calm expression. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) drew
level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very crooked nose.
The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some
looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised
their hands and waved in welcome.
A powerful emotion had risen in Harrys chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful
feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wanted to catch Dumbledores eye, but
Dumbledore was not looking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) way; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered
Fudge.
``Ah,'' said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. ``Dumbledore. Yes. You - er - got our - er - message that the time and -er - place of the hearing had been changed, then?''
``I must have missed it,'' said Dumbledore cheerfully...``However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.''
``Yes - well - I suppose well need another chair - I - Weasley, could you -?''
``Not to worry, not to worry,'' said Dumbledore pleasantly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand, gave it a little
flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat
down, put the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) long fingers together and surveyed Fudge over them with an expression
of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge
spoke again did they settle down.
``Yes,'' said Fudge again, shuffling his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) notes. ``Well, then. So. The charges. Yes.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), took a deep breath, and read out,
``the charges against the accused are as follows: That he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) did knowingly, deliberately and in full
awareness of the illegality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) actions, having received a previous written warning from the
Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in
the presence of a Muggle, on the second of August at twenty-three minutes past nine, which
constitutes an offence under Paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of
Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under Section 13 of the International Confederation of
Warlocks Statute of Secrecy.
<div class="bookquote">``You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parchment.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said.
<div class="bookquote">``You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did
you not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``but -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of
seventeen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry angrily, <div class="bookquote">``but I only used it because we were -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>The witch with the monocle cut across him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in a booming voice.
<div class="bookquote">``You produced a fully-fledged Patronus?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``because -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A corporeal Patronus?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A - what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean t o say, it was more than vapour or smoke?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, <div class="bookquote">``its a stag, its always a stag.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Always?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>boomed Madam Bones. <div class="bookquote">``You have produced a Patronus before now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``Ive been doing it for over a year.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you are fifteen years old?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You learned this at school?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Bones</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Impressive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Bones</b></font>)</div>said Madam Bones, staring down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``a true Patronus at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) age... very
impressive indeed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Some of the wizards and witches around her (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) were muttering again; a few nodded, but others
were frowning and shaking their heads.
<div class="bookquote">``Its not a question of how impressive the magic was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge in a testy voice, <div class="bookquote">``in fact, the
more impressive the worse it is, I would have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a
Muggle!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but it was the sight of Percys
sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into speech.
<div class="bookquote">``I did it because of the Dementors!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said loudly, before anyone could interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than
before.
<div class="bookquote">``Dementors?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Bones</b></font>)</div>said Madam Bones after a moment, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) thick eyebrows rising until her (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) monocle
looked in danger of falling out. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, boy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean there were two Dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around at the Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. Yes, I thought wed be hearing something like this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dementors in Little Whinging?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Madam Bones said, in a tone of great surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I dont
understand -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont you, Amelia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, still smirking. <div class="bookquote">``Let me explain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)s been thinking it through
and decided Dementors would make a very nice little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles
cant see Dementors, can they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient... so its just your
word and no witnesses...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im not lying!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of muttering from the court. <div class="bookquote">``There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Enough, enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, with a very supercilious look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Im sorry to interrupt
what Im sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again.
<div class="bookquote">``We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of Dementors in that alleyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Fudges plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stared down
at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back
together, said, <div class="bookquote">``We havent got time to listen to more tarradiddles, Im afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly -''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I may be wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore pleasantly, <div class="bookquote">``but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) case? Isnt that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) continued, addressing the witch in the monocle.
<div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Madam Bones. <div class="bookquote">``Perfectly true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>snapped Fudge. <div class="bookquote">``Where is this person?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s just outside the door. Should I -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No -- Weasley, you go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, ran down the stone steps
from the judges balcony and hurried past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.
A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. Figg. She (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) looked scared and more batty than
ever. Harry wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) had thought to change out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) carpet slippers.
Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) chair, conjuring a second one for himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Full name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) seal.
<div class="bookquote">``Arabella Doreen Figg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg in her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) quavery voice.
<div class="bookquote">``And who exactly are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Im a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg.
<div class="bookquote">``We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging, other than Harry Potter,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Madam Bones at once. <div class="bookquote">``That situation has always been closely monitored, given... given
past events.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im a Squib,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg. <div class="bookquote">``So you wouldnt have me registered, would you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A Squib, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, eyeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) closely. <div class="bookquote">``Well be checking that. Youll leave details of your parentage with my assistant Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see Dementors?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) added,
looking left and right along the bench.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, we can!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg indignantly.
Fudge looked back down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) eyebrows raised. <div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said aloofly. <div class="bookquote">``What is your
story?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, around about
nine oclock, on the evening of the second of August,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>)
had learned what she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) was saying by heart, <div class="bookquote">``when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway
between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw
Dementors running -''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Running?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Madam Bones sharply. <div class="bookquote">``Dementors dont run, they glide.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats what I meant to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) withered
cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``Gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What did they look like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Bones</b></font>)</div>said Madam Bones, narrowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) eyes so that the edge of the
monocle disappeared into her (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) flesh.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Madam Bones impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``The Dementors... describe them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) neck now. <div class="bookquote">``They were big. Big and wearing
cloaks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach. Whatever Mrs. Figg might say, it sounded
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as though the most she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) had ever seen was a picture of a Dementor, and a picture could
never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering
inches over the ground; or the rotting smell of them; or that terrible rattling noise they made as
they sucked on the surrounding air...
In the second row, a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the
ear of his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) neighbor, a frizzy-haired witch. She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) smirked and nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``Big and wearing cloaks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. <div class="bookquote">``I see. Anything else?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg. <div class="bookquote">``I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summers
night, mark you. And I felt... as though all happiness had gone from the world... and I
remembered... dreadful things...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) voice shook and died.
Madam Boness eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) eyebrow where the
monocle had dug into it.
<div class="bookquote">``What did the Dementors do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope.
<div class="bookquote">``They went for the boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Figg, her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) voice stronger and more confident now, the pink
flush ebbing away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``One of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to
repel the Dementor. That was Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried twice and produced only silver vapour. On the
third attempt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) produced a Patronus, which charged down the first Dementor and then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
encouragement, chased the second one away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin. And that that is what happened,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Figg finished, somewhat lamely.
Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence. Fudge was not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>) at all, but
fidgeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) papers. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes and said, rather aggressively, <div class="bookquote">``thats what
you saw, is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is what happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Figg repeated.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge. <div class="bookquote">``You may go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Figg</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off
towards the door. Harry heard it thud shut behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Figg</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Not a very convincing witness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge loftily.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I dont know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Bones</b></font>)</div>said Madam Bones, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) booming voice. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) certainly described the effects of a Dementor attack very accurately. And I cant imagine why she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would say they were there if they werent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>snorted Fudge. <div class="bookquote">``The odds on that must be very, very long. Even Bagman wouldnt have bet -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I dont think any of us believe the Dementors were there by coincidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore
lightly.
The witch sitting to the right of Fudge, with her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) face in shadow, moved slightly but everyone
else was quite still and silent.
<div class="bookquote">``And what is that supposed to mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>Fudge asked icily.
<div class="bookquote">``It means that I think they were ordered there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore.
<div class="bookquote">``I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of Dementors to go strolling
through Little Whanging!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>barked Fudge.
<div class="bookquote">``Not if the Dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these
days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore calmly. <div class="bookquote">``I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge forcefully, <div class="bookquote">``and I have no reason to believe that your views are
anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The Dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are
doing everything we ask them to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, <div class="bookquote">``we must ask ourselves why somebody within the
Ministry ordered a pair of Dementors into that alleyway on the second of August.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forwards
so that Harry saw her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) for the first time.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) looked just like a large, pale toad. She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) was rather squat with a broad, flabby face,
as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide, slack mouth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) eyes were large, round and
slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) short curly hair put him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)
in mind of a large fly she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) was about to catch on a long sticky tongue.
<div class="bookquote">``The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said
Fudge.
The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been
expecting a croak.
<div class="bookquote">``Im sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) said, with a simper that left her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) big, round eyes as cold as ever. <div class="bookquote">``So silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harrys neck stand up. A few other
members of the Wizengamot laughed with her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>). It could not have been plainer that not one of
them was really amused.
<div class="bookquote">``If it is true that the Dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also
true that two Dementors attacked Harry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that
somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore politely. <div class="bookquote">``Of course,
these particular Dementors may have been outside Ministry control -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There are no Dementors outside Ministry control!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red.
Dumbledore inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) head in a little bow.
<div class="bookquote">``Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two Dementors were so
very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorization.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge shade</b></font>)</div>snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would have been proud.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course it isnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore mildly. <div class="bookquote">``I was merely expressing my confidence that this
matter will not go uninvestigated.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) monocle and stared back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), frowning
slightly.
<div class="bookquote">``I would remind everybody that the behavior of these Dementors, if indeed they are not
figments of this boys imagination, is not the subject of this hearing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge. <div class="bookquote">``We are here to examine Harry Potters offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage
Sorcery!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, <div class="bookquote">``but the presence of Dementors in that alleyway is highly
relevant. Clause Seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in
exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which
threaten the life of the wizard or witch him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) - or herself, or any witches, wizards or Muggles
present at the time of the -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We are familiar with Clause Seven, thank you very much!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>snarled Fudge.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore courteously. <div class="bookquote">``Then we are in agreement that Harrys use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional
circumstances the clause describes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If there were Dementors, which I doubt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have heard it from an eyewitness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``If you still doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) truthfulness, call her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) back, question her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) again. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) would not object.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I - that - not -''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Its - I want this over with
today, Dumbledore!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative
was a serious miscarriage of justice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore.
<div class="bookquote">``Serious miscarriage, my hat!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Have you ever bothered to tot
up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to
cover up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose youve forgotten the Hover
Charm he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) used three years ago -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That wasnt me, it was a house-elf!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``YOU SEE''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harrys direction. <div class="bookquote">``A house-elf! In a
Muggle house! I ask you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``I
can summon him (<font color='blue'><b>School</b></font>) here in an instant to give evidence if you wish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I - not - I havent got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, thats not the only - he (<font color='blue'><b>School</b></font>) blew up his (<font color='blue'><b>School</b></font>)
aunt, for Gods sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>Fudge shouted, banging his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) fist on the judges bench and upsetting a bottle of ink.
<div class="bookquote">``And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the
best wizards cannot always control their emotions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) notes.
<div class="bookquote">``And I havent even started on what he (<font color='blue'><b>School</b></font>) gets up to at school.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school,
Harrys behavior there is not relevant to this hearing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, as politely as ever, but
now with a suggestion of coolness behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) words.
<div class="bookquote">``Oho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge. <div class="bookquote">``Not our business what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) does at school, eh? You think so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you
on the night of the second of August,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven; again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Laws can be changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge savagely.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course they can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the
Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple
matter of underage magic!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the wizards</b></font>)</div>A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Fudge turned a slightly
deeper shade of puce. The toadlike witch on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore,
her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) face quite expressionless.
<div class="bookquote">``As far as I am aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore continued, <div class="bookquote">``there is no law yet in place that says this courts
job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has ever performed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has been charged with a
specific offence and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has presented his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) defense. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and I can do now is to await your
verdict.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore put his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) fingertips together again and said no more. Fudge glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), evidently
incensed. Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was not at all sure that
Dumbledore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a
decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harrys attempt to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) eye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
continued to look up at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent,
whispered conversations.
Harry looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart, which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size, was
thumping loudly under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ribs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had expected the hearing to last longer than this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not
at all sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had made a good impression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not really said very much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ought to
have explained more fully about the Dementors, about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had fallen over, about how both
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Dudley had nearly been kissed...
Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up at Fudge and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth to speak, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swollen heart was now
constricting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) air passages and both times he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) merely took a deep breath and looked back down
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoes.
Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the judges, but found that it was really
much, much easier to keep examining his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) laces.
<div class="bookquote">``Those in favor of clearing the witness of all charges?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Madam Boness booming voice.
Harrys head jerked upwards. There were hands in the air, many of them... more than half!
Breathing very fast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to count, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could finish, Madam Bones had said, <div class="bookquote">``And
those in favor of conviction?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Bones</b></font>)</div>Fudge raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand; so did half a dozen others, including the witch on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right and the
heavily-moustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in the second row.
Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something large stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
throat, then lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took two deep breaths and said, in a voice distorted by
suppressed rage, <div class="bookquote">``Very well, very well... cleared of all charges.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) feet, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand and causing the
two chintz armchairs to vanish. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I must be getting along. Good-day to you all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>And without looking once at Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swept from the dungeon.
CHAPTER NINE
The Woes of Mrs. Weasley
Dumbledores abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remained sitting where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was in the chained chair, struggling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were
all getting to their feet, talking, gathering up their papers and packing them away. Harry stood
up. Nobody seemed to be paying him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) the slightest bit of attention, except the toadlike witch on
Fudges right, who was now gazing down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) tried
to catch Fudges eye, or Madam Boness, wanting to ask whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was free to go, but Fudge
seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) briefcase, so
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a few tentative steps towards the exit and, when nobody called him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back, broke into a
very fast walk.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open the door and almost collided with Mr.
Weasley, who was standing right outside, looking pale and apprehensive.
<div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore didnt say -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cleared,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``of all charges!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Beaming, Mr. Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, thats wonderful! Well, of course, they couldnt have found you guilty, not on the
evidence, but even so, I cant pretend I wasnt -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>But Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had just opened again. The Wizengamot
were filing out.
<div class="bookquote">``Merlins beard!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside to let them all pass.
<div class="bookquote">``You were tried by the full court?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quietly.
One or two of the wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a few, including Madam Bones,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Morning, Arthur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Bones</b></font>)</div>to Mr. Weasley, but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the
toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as though Mr. Weasley
and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)
passed. Last of all to pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) completely ignored his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father and Harry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back rigid and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose in the air. The lines around Mr. Weasleys mouth tightened slightly, but other than this
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) gave no sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) third son.
<div class="bookquote">``Im going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said, beckoning Harry forwards as Percys heels disappeared up the steps to Level Nine. <div class="bookquote">``Ill drop you off on the way to that toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So, what will you have to do about the toilet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, grinning. Everything suddenly
seemed five times funnier than usual. It was starting to sink in: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was cleared, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going back to Hogwarts.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, its a simple enough anti-jinx,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley as they mounted the stairs, <div class="bookquote">``but its not so
much having to repair the damage, its more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Mugglebaiting might strike some wizards as funny, but its an expression of something much deeper and nastier, and I for one -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just reached the ninth-level corridor and
Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet away from them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek
blond hair and a pointed, pale face.
The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, broke off in mid-conversation,
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon Harrys face.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, well, well... Patronus Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>said Lucius Malfoy coolly.
Harry felt winded, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just walked into something solid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had last seen those cold
grey eyes through slits in a Death Eaters hood, and last heard that mans voice jeering in a dark
graveyard while Lord Voldemort tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>). Harry could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared
look him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the face; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that
Cornelius Fudge was talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>), when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy
was a Death Eater.
<div class="bookquote">``The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Malfoy</b></font>)</div>drawled Mr. Malfoy. <div class="bookquote">``Quite
astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes... snakelike, in fact.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley gripped Harrys shoulder in warning.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``yeah, Im good at escaping.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Lucius Malfoy raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes to Mr. Weasleys face.
<div class="bookquote">``And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I work here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley curtly.
<div class="bookquote">``Not here, surely?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Malfoy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Malfoy, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) eye brows and glancing towards the door over
Mr. Weasleys shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you were up on the second floor... dont you do something
that involves sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley snapped, his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) fingers now biting into Harrys shoulder.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you doing here, anyway?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes. Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what
sounded like a full pocket of gold. <div class="bookquote">``Really, just because you are Dumbledores favorite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us... shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back on Harry and Mr. Weasley. <div class="bookquote">``This way, Lucius.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. Weasley did not let go of Harrys shoulder
until they had disappeared into the lift.
<div class="bookquote">``Why wasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) waiting outside Fudges office if theyve got business to do together?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry
burst out furiously. <div class="bookquote">``What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) doing down here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely
agitated and glancing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard.
<div class="bookquote">``Trying to find out whether youd been expelled or not. Ill leave a note for Dumbledore when I
drop you off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) ought to know Malfoys been talking to Fudge again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What private business have they got together, anyway?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Gold, I expect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Malfoys been giving generously to all sorts of
things for years... gets him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) in with the right people... then he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) can ask favors... delay laws he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
doesnt want passed... oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)s very well-connected, Lucius Malfoy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around Mr. Weasleys
head as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors clanged shut. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) waved them away
irritably.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Weasley''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry slowly, <div class="bookquote">``if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)s seeing
them alone, how do we know they havent put the Imperius Curse on him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont think it hasnt occurred to us, Harry''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley quietly. <div class="bookquote">``But Dumbledore thinks
Fudge is acting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own accord at the moment - which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of
comfort. Best not talk about it any more just now, Harry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted Atrium. Eric the
watchwizard was hidden behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) Daily Prophet again. They had walked straight past the
golden fountain before Harry remembered.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told Mr. Weasley, and, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moneybag from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned back to the
fountain.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up into the handsome wizards face, but up close Harry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked rather weak
and foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry
knew of goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans
of any description. Only the house-elfs attitude of creeping servility looked convincing. With a
grin at the thought of what Hermione would say if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could see the statue of the elf, Harry
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moneybag upside-down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into
the pool.
<div class="bookquote">``I knew it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>yelled Ron, punching the air. <div class="bookquote">``You always get away with stuff!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They were bound to clear you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, who had looked positively faint with anxiety
when Harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``there
was no case against you, none at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering you all knew Id get off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry,
smiling.
Mrs. Weasley was wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) face on her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) apron, and Fred, George and Ginny were doing a kind
of war dance to a chant that went: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got off...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats enough! Settle down!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>shouted Mr. Weasley, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) too was smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, Sirius,
Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius sharply.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) got off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) got off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) got off...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) talking to Fudge on Level Nine, then they went up to
Fudges office together. Dumbledore ought to know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``Well tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), dont worry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Id better get going, theres a vomiting toilet waiting for me in Bethnal Green. Molly, Ill
be late, Im covering for Tonks, but Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) got off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) got off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) got off...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats enough - Fred - George - Ginny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasley, as Mr. Weasley left the kitchen.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, dear, come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), looking happier than they had done since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had first arrived at Grimmauld Place, and Harrys feeling of giddy relief, which had been
somewhat dented by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) encounter with Lucius Malfoy, swelled again. The gloomy house
seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
poked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise.
<div class="bookquote">``Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron happily, now dishing great mounds of mashed potatoes on to everyones plates.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) swung it for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt it would sound highly ungrateful, not to mention
childish, to say, <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)d talked to me, though. Or even looked at me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought this, the scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead burned so badly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand to it.
<div class="bookquote">``Whats up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking alarmed.
<div class="bookquote">``Scar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry mumbled. <div class="bookquote">``But its nothing... it happens all the time now...''
 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping themselves to food while
gloating over Harrys narrow escape; Fred, George and Ginny were still singing. Hermione
looked rather anxious, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could say anything, Ron had said happily, <div class="bookquote">``I bet
Dumbledore turns up this evening, to celebrate with us, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)ll be able to, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasley, setting a huge plate of roast chicken
down in front of Harry. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s really very busy at the moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) GOT OFF, HE (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) GOT OFF, HE (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) GOT OFF''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``SHUT UP!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>roared Mrs. Weasley.
Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number
twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be returning to
Hogwarts. Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing
Harrys hand and beaming just like the rest of them. Soon, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was moodier and surlier
than before, talking less to everybody, even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut
up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mothers room with Buckbeak.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont you go feeling guilty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione sternly, after Harry had confided some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
feelings to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and Ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days
later. <div class="bookquote">``You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s being selfish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats a bit harsh, Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, frowning as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) attempted to prize off a bit of mould
that had attached itself firmly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) finger, <div class="bookquote">``you wouldnt want to be stuck inside this house
without any company.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)ll have company!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Its Headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix, isnt it?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) just got his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) hopes up that Harry would be coming to live here with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont think thats true''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, wringing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cloth. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wouldnt give me a straight
answer when I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) if I could.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) just didnt want to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own hopes up even more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione wisely. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I think a part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was really hoping youd be
expelled. Then youd both be outcasts together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come off it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely shrugged.
<div class="bookquote">``Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Rons mums right and Sirius gets confused about whether youre you or your father, Harry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s touched in the head?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry heatedly.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I just think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s been very lonely for a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione simply.
At this point, Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them.
<div class="bookquote">``Still not finished?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, poking her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) head into the cupboard.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Dyou know how
much mould weve got rid of since we arrived here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You were so keen to help the Order,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasley, <div class="bookquote">``you can do your bit by making
Headquarters fit to live in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I feel like a house-elf,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>grumbled Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, now you understand what dreadful lives they lead, perhaps youll be a bit more active in
SPEW!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione hopefully, as Mrs. Weasley left them to it. <div class="bookquote">``You know, maybe it
wouldnt be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time - we could
do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to SPEW, it would raise
awareness as well as funds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ill sponsor you to shut up about SPEW,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron muttered irritably, but only so Harry could hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays
approached; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not wait to see Hagrid again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the
vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses; it would be a treat just to leave this dusty,
musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults
out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot
of Sirius.
The fact was that living at the Headquarters of the anti-Voldemort movement was not nearly as
interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d experienced it. Though
members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals,
sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation, Mrs. Weasley made sure that
Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot -LRB-whether Extendable or normal-RRB- and nobody,
not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard on
the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arrival.
On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwigs owl droppings from the top
of the wardrobe when Ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.
<div class="bookquote">``Booklists have arrived,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, throwing one of the envelopes up to Harry, who was standing
on a chair. <div class="bookquote">``About time, I thought theyd forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over Rons head into
the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) then opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
letter. It contained two pieces of parchment: one the usual reminder that term started on the first
of September; the other telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) which books he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) would need for the coming year.
<div class="bookquote">``Only two new ones,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, reading the list, <div class="bookquote">``The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, by
Miranda Goshawk, and Defensive Magical Theory, by Wilbert Slinkhard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Crack.
Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so used to them doing this by now that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didnt even fall off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair.
<div class="bookquote">``We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred conversationally.
<div class="bookquote">``Because it means Dumbledores found a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said
George.
<div class="bookquote">``And about time too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred.
<div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, jumping down beside them.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred told
Harry, <div class="bookquote">``and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to
do the job this year.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not surprising, is it, when you look at whats happened to the last four?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.
<div class="bookquote">``One sacked, one dead, ones memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said
Harry, counting them off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I see what you mean.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whats up with you, Ron?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>asked Fred.
Ron did not answer. Harry looked round. Ron was standing very still with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth slightly
open, gaping at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) letter from Hogwarts.
<div class="bookquote">``Whats the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) shoulder at the
parchment.
Freds mouth fell open, too.
<div class="bookquote">``Prefect?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, staring incredulously at the letter. <div class="bookquote">``Prefect?''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>George leapt forwards, seized the envelope in Rons other hand and turned it upside-down. Harry
saw something scarlet and gold fall into Georges palm.
<div class="bookquote">``No way,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George in a hushed voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Theres been a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, snatching the letter out of Rons grasp and holding it up to
the light as though checking for a watermark. <div class="bookquote">``No one in their right mind would make Ron a
prefect.''
 (<font color='red'><b>twins</b></font>)</div>The twins heads turned in unison and both of them stared at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``We thought you were a cert!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, in a tone that suggested Harry had tricked them in some way.
<div class="bookquote">``We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George indignantly.
<div class="bookquote">``Winning the Triwizard and everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose all the mad stuff mustve counted against him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George to Fred.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, youve caused too much trouble, mate. Well, at least one of
yous got their priorities right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) strode over to Harry and clapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) on the back while giving Ron a scathing look.
<div class="bookquote">``Prefect... ickle Ronnie the Prefect.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mums going to be revolting,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge back at Ron as
though it might contaminate him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).
Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a moment, then held it out to
Harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large P was
superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen a badge just like this on Percys chest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)
very first day at Hogwarts.
The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cheeks flushed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hair
flying. There was an envelope in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you - did you get -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) spotted the badge in Harrys hand and let out a shriek.
``I knew it! she (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said excitedly, brandishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) letter. ``Me too, Harry, me too!''
``No,'' said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Rons hand. ``Its Ron, not me.''
``It - what?''
``Rons prefect, not me,'' Harry said.
``Ron?'' said Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) jaw dropping. ``But... are you sure? I mean -''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) turned red as Ron looked round at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) with a defiant expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face.
``Its my name on the letter,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said.
``I...'' said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. ``I... well... wow! Well done, Ron! Thats
really -''
``Unexpected,'' said George, nodding.
``No,'' said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, ``no its not... Rons done loads of... he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s
really...''
The door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) opened a little wider and Mrs. Weasley backed into the room carrying a pile
of freshly laundered robes.
``Ginny said the booklists had come at last,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, glancing around at all the envelopes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles. ``If you give them to
me Ill take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while youre packing.
Ron, Ill have to get you more pajamas, these are at least six inches too short, I cant believe how
fast youre growing... what color would you like?''
``Get him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) red and gold to match his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) badge,'' said George, smirking.
``Match his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) what?'' said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing
them on Rons pile.
``His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) badge,'' said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly. ``His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) lovely shiny
new prefects badge.''
Freds words took a moment to penetrate Mrs. Weasleys preoccupation with pajamas.
``His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)... but... Ron, youre not...?''
Ron held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) badge.
Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermiones.
``I dont believe it! I dont believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! Thats everyone in the
family!''
``What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?'' said George indignantly, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mother pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
aside and flung her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms around her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) youngest son.
``Wait until your father hears! Ron, Im so proud of you, what wonderful news, you could end up
Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, its the first step! Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of
all this worry, Im just thrilled, oh, Ronnie --''
Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back but Mrs. Weasley did
not notice; arms tight around Rons neck, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face, which had turned
a brighter scarlet than his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) badge.
``Mum... dont... Mum, get a grip...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) muttered, trying to push her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) away.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) let go of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and said breathlessly, ``Well, what will it be? We gave Percy an owl, but youve already got one, of course.''
``W-what do you mean?'' said Ron, looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) did not dare believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ears.
``Youve got to have a reward for this!'' said Mrs. Weasley fondly. ``How about a nice new set of
dress robes?''
``Weve already bought him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) some,'' said Fred sourly, who looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) sincerely regretted this generosity.
``Or a new cauldron, Charlies old ones rusting through, or a new rat, you always liked Scabbers''
``Mum,'' said Ron hopefully, ``can I have a new broom?''
Mrs. Weasleys face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive.
``Not a really good one!'' Ron hastened to add. ``Just - just a new one for a change...''
Mrs. Weasley hesitated, then smiled.
``Of course you can... well, Id better get going if Ive got a broom to buy too. Ill see you all
later... little Ronnie, a prefect! And dont forget to pack your trunks... a prefect... oh, Im all of
a dither!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bustled from the room.
Fred and George exchanged looks.
``You dont mind if we dont kiss you, do you, Ron?'' said Fred in a falsely anxious voice.
``We could curtsey, if you like,'' said George.
``Oh, shut up,'' said Ron, scowling at them.
``Or what?'' said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) face. ``Going to put us in detention?''
``Id love to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) try,'' sniggered George.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could if you dont watch out!'' said Hermione angrily.
Fred and George burst out laughing, and Ron muttered, ``Drop it, Hermione.''
``Were going to have to watch our step, George,'' said Fred, pretending to tremble, ``with these
two on our case...''
``Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,'' said George, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) head.
And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated.
``Those two!'' said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling, through which they could now
hear Fred and George roaring with laughter in the room upstairs. ``Dont pay any attention to
them, Ron, theyre only jealous!''
``I dont think they are,'' said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the ceiling. ``Theyve always said only prats become prefects... still,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) added on a happier note, ``theyve never had new brooms! I wish I could go with Mum and choose... she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)ll never be able to afford a Nimbus, but theres the new Cleansweep out, thatd be great... yeah, I think Ill go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) I like the Cleansweep, just so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) knows.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone.
For some reason, Harry found he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not want to look at Hermione. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed, picked
up the pile of clean robes Mrs. Weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk.
``Harry?'' said Hermione tentatively.
``Well done, Hermione,'' said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice at all, and, still not
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), ``brilliant. Prefect. Great.''
``Thanks,'' said Hermione. ``Erm - Harry - could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad?
Theyll be really pleased - I mean prefect is something they can understand.''
``Yeah, no problem,'' said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leaned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for
something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments
passed; Harry heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner
coughing up the owl droppings.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) straightened up and looked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Hermione had left and Hedwig had gone. Harry
hurried across the room, closed the door, then returned slowly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed and sank on to it, gazing
unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been too
anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be
winging their way towards certain people. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had remembered... if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had thought about
it... what would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) have expected?
Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head.
Harry screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face and buried it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not lie to himself; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had known
the prefect badge was on its way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have expected it to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), not Ron. Did this
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) think himself superior to everyone else? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
really believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was better than Ron?
No, said the small voice defiantly.
Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own feelings.
Im better at Quidditch, said the voice. But Im not better at anything else.
That was definitely true, Harry thought; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was no better than Ron in lessons. But what about
outside lessons? What about those adventures he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Ron and Hermione had had together since
starting at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?
Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice in Harrys head.
Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didnt fight Quirrell with me. They
didnt take on Riddle and the Basilisk. They didnt get rid of all those Dementors the night Sirius
escaped. They werent in that graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned...
And the same feeling of ill-usage that had overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) on the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had arrived rose
again. Ive definitely done more, Harry thought indignantly. Ive done more than either of them!
But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesnt choose prefects because
theyve got themselves into a load of dangerous situations... maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) chooses them for other
reasons... Ron must have something you dont...
Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes and stared through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers at the wardrobes clawed feet, remembering
what Fred had said: ``No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect...''
Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt sickened with himself.
Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) the prefect badge. This was not Rons fault. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>),
Harry, Rons best friend in the world, going to sulk because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) didnt have a badge, laugh with
the twins behind Rons back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had beaten Harry at
something?
At this point Harry heard Rons footsteps on the stairs again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood up, straightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
glasses, and hitched a grin on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face as Ron bounded back through the door.
``Just caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said happily. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)ll get the Cleansweep if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) can.''
``Cool,'' Harry said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was relieved to hear that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice had stopped sounding hearty.
``Listen - Ron - well done, mate.''
The smile faded off Rons face.
``I never thought it would be me!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head. ``I thought it would be you!''
``Nah, Ive caused too much trouble,'' Harry said, echoing Fred.
``Yeah,'' said Ron, ``yeah, I suppose... well, wed better get our trunks packed, hadnt we?''
It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had
arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over
the house and stow them back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron kept moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
prefects badge around, first placing it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bedside table, then putting it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) jeans pocket,
then taking it out and lying it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the
black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) forehead with a
Permanent Sticking Charm did he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wrap it tenderly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) maroon socks and lock it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) trunk.
Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six oclock, laden with books and carrying a
long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) with a moan of longing.
``Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want you all downstairs,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
said, but the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was out of sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined
every inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) new broom, an ecstatic expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face.
Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner
table, which read:
CONGRATULATIONS
RON AND HERMIONE
NEW PREFECTS
She (<font color='blue'><b>HERMIONE</b></font>) looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>HERMIONE</b></font>) all holiday.
``I thought wed have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>HERMIONE</b></font>) told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred,
George and Ginny as they entered the room. ``Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron. Ive
sent them both owls and theyre thrilled,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) added, beaming.
Fred rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) eyes.
Sirius, Lupin, Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there and Mad-Eye Moody stumped
in shortly after Harry had got himself a Butterbeer.
``Oh, Alastor, I am glad youre here,'' said Mrs. Weasley brightly, as Mad-Eye shrugged off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mad-Eye</b></font>)
traveling cloak. ``Weve been wanting to ask you for ages - could you have a look in the writing
desk in the drawing room and tell us whats inside it? We havent wanted to open it just in case
its something really nasty.''
``No problem, Molly...''
Moodys electric-blue eye swiveled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the
kitchen.
``Drawing room...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mad-Eye</b></font>) growled, as the pupil contracted. ``Desk in the corner? Yeah, I see it...
yeah, its a Boggart... want me to go up and get rid of it, Molly?''
``No, no, Ill do it myself later,'' beamed Mrs. Weasley, ``you have your drink. Were having a
little bit of a celebration, actually...'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) gesture d at the scarlet banner. ``Fourth prefect in the
family!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said fondly, ruffling Rons hair.
``Prefect, eh?'' growled Moody, his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) normal eye on Ron and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) magical eye swiveling around to
gaze into the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head. Harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
and moved away towards Sirius and Lupin.
``Well, congratulations,'' said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) normal eye, ``authority figures
always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wouldnt have appointed you...''
Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by
the arrival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) father and eldest brother. Mrs. Weasley was in such a good mood she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) did not
even complain that they had brought Mundungus with them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) was wearing a long overcoat that
seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with
Moodys traveling cloak.
``Well, I think a toast is in order,'' said Mr. Weasley, when everyone had a drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
goblet. ``To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects!''
Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them, and then applauded.
``I was never a prefect myself,'' said Tonks brightly from behind Harry as everybody moved
towards the table to help themselves to food. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hair was tomato red and waist-length today;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked like Ginnys older sister. ``My Head of House said I lacked certain necessary
qualities.''
``Like what?'' said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato.
``Like the ability to behave myself,'' said Tonks.
Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) did not know whether to smile or not and
compromised by taking an extra large gulp of Butterbeer and choking on it.
``What about you, Sirius?'' Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on the back.
Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) usual bark-like laugh.
``No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James. Lupin
was the good boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) got the badge.''
``I think Dumbledore might have hoped I would be able to exercise some control over my best
friends,'' said Lupin. ``I need scarcely say that I failed dismally.<div class="bookquote">''
Harrys mood suddenly lifted. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father had not been a prefect either. All at once the party
seemed much more enjoyable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loaded up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) plate, feeling doubly fond of everyone in the
room.
Ron was rhapsodizing about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) new broom to anybody who would listen.
'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>... nought to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you think the Comet Two Ninetys
only nought to sixty and thats with a decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick?''
Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) view of elf rights.
``I mean, its the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation, isnt it? It all stems from this
horrible thing wizards have of thinking theyre superior to other creatures...<div class="bookquote">''
Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bills hair.
'' (<font color='red'><b>creatures</b></font>)</div>... getting really out of hand, and youre so good-looking, it would look much better shorter,
wouldnt it, Harry?''
``Oh - I dunno -'' said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opinion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slid away from them
in the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.
Mundungus stopped talking when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) saw Harry, but Fred winked and beckoned Harry closer.
``Its okay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told Mundungus, ``we can trust Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s our financial backer.''
``Look what Dungs got us,'' said George, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand to Harry. It was full of what
looked like shriveled black pods. A faint rattling noise was coming from them, even though they
were completely stationary.
``Venomous Tentacula seeds,'' said George. ``We need them for the Skiving Snackboxes but
theyre a Class C Non-Tradable Substance so weve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of
them.''
``Ten Galleons the lot, then Dung?'' said Fred.
``Wiv all the trouble I went to to get em?'' said Mundungus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching
even wider. ``Im sorry, lads, but Im not taking a Knut under twenty.''
``Dung likes his (<font color='blue'><b>Knut</b></font>) little joke,'' Fred said to Harry.
``Yeah, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knut</b></font>) best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of Knarl quills,'' said George.
``Be careful,'' Harry warned them quietly.
``What?'' said Fred. ``Mums busy cooing over Prefect Ron, were okay.''
``But Moody could have his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) eye on you,'' Harry pointed out.
Mundungus looked nervously over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder.
``Good point, that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grunted. ``All right, lads, ten it is, if youll take em quick.''
``Cheers, Harry!'' said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) pockets into the twins outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food. ``Wed better get these upstairs...<div class="bookquote">''
Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley would want to know how Fred and George were financing their joke shop business
when, as was inevitable, they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) Triwizard winnings
had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another family row and a Percylike estrangement? Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) son if she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) found out he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) thought quite unsuitable?
Standing where the twins had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) stomach
for company, Harry caught the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own name. Kingsley Shacklebolts deep voice was
audible even over the surrounding chatter.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>... why Dumbledore didnt make Potter a prefect?'' said Kingsley.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)ll have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reasons,'' replied Lupin.
``But it wouldve shown confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Its what Idve done,'' persisted Kingsley, ``specially
with the Daily Prophet having a go at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) every few days...<div class="bookquote">''
Harry did not look round; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not want Lupin or Kingsley to know he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard. Though not
remotely hungry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) followed Mundungus back towards the table. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pleasure in the party had
evaporated as quickly as it had come; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were upstairs in bed.
Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken-leg with what remained of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) nose; evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>)
could not detect any trace of poison, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) then tore a strip off it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) teeth.
'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>... the handles made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and in-built vibration control -'' Ron
was saying to Tonks.
Mrs. Weasley yawned widely.
``Well, I think Ill sort out that Boggart before I turn in... Arthur, I dont want this lot up too late,
all right? Night, Harry, dear.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) left the kitchen. Harry set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) plate and wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) without
attracting attention.
``You all right, Potter?'' grunted Moody.
``Yeah, fine,'' lied Harry.
Moody took a swig from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hipflask, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) electric-blue eye staring sideways at Harry.
``Come here, Ive got something that might interest you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
From an inner pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes Moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photograph.
``Original Order of the Phoenix,'' growled Moody. ``Found it last night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore hasnt had the manners to return my best one...
thought people might like to see it.''
Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), others lifting their
glasses, looked back up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Theres me,'' said Moody, unnecessarily pointing at himself. The Moody in the picture was
unmistakable, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) hair was slightly less grey and his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) nose was intact. ``And theres
Dumbledore beside me, Dedalus Diggle on the other side... thats Marlene McKinnon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marlene</b></font>) was
killed two weeks after this was taken, they got her (<font color='blue'><b>Marlene</b></font>) whole family. Thats Frank and Alice
Longbottom -<div class="bookquote">''
Harrys stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked at Alice Longbottom; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) round, friendly face very well, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never met her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) was the image
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) son, Neville.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Alice Longbottom/Alice</b></font>)</div>-- poor devils,'' growled Moody. ``Better dead than what happened to them... and thats
Emmeline Vance, youve met her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>), and that theres Lupin, obviously... Benjy Fenwick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>)
copped it too, we only ever found bits of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>)... shift aside there,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) added, poking the picture,
and the little photographic people edged sideways, so that those who were partially obscured
could move to the front.
``Thats Edgar Bones... brother of Amelia Bones, they got him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) family, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was a great wizard... Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) looks young... Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never found his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) body... Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as ever...
Elphias Doge, youve met him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), Id forgotten he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) used to wear that stupid hat... Gideon Prewett, it
took five Death Eaters to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Prewett</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prewett</b></font>) brother Fabian, they fought like heroes... budge along,
budge along...''
The little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back
appeared at the forefront of the picture.
``Thats Dumbledores brother Aberforth, only time I ever met him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), strange bloke... thats
Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) personally... Sirius, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) still had short hair...
and... there you go, thought that would interest you!''
Harrys heart turned over. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother and father were beaming up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), sitting on either side
of a small, watery-eyed man whom Harry recognized at once as Wormtail, the one who had
betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parents whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths.
``Eh?'' said Moody.
Harry looked up into Moodys heavily scarred and pitted face. Evidently Moody was under the
impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) had just given Harry a bit of a treat.
``Yeah,'' said Harry, once again attempting to grin. ``Er... listen, Ive just remembered, I havent
packed my...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was spared the trouble of inventing an object he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not packed. Sirius had just said, ``Whats
that youve got there, Mad-Eye?'' and Moody had turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>). Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not know why it had been such a shock; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen pictures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parents before, after
all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had met Wormtail but to have them sprung on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) like that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was least
expecting it... no one would like that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought angrily...
And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces... Benjy Fenwick, who had
been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had
been tortured into madness... all waving happily out of the photograph forever more, not
knowing that they were doomed... well, Moody might find that interesting... he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>), Harry, found it
disturbing...
Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf-heads, glad to be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own again, but
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) approached the first landing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard noises. Someone was sobbing in the drawing room.
``Hello?'' Harry said.
There was no answer but the sobbing continued. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) climbed the remaining stairs two at a time,
walked across the landing and opened the drawing-room door.
Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wand in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) whole body shaking
with sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron.
All the air seemed to vanish from Harrys lungs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were falling through the
floor; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain turned icy cold - Ron dead, no, it couldnt be -
But wait a moment, it couldnt be - Ron was downstairs -
``Mrs. Weasley?'' Harry croaked.
``R - r - riddikulus!'' Mrs. Weasley sobbed, pointing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) shaking wand at Rons body.
Crack.
Rons body turned into Bills, spread-eagled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes wide open and empty. Mrs.
Weasley sobbed harder than ever.
``R -riddikulus!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) sobbed again.
Crack.
Mr. Weasleys body replaced Bills, his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) glasses askew, a trickle of blood running down his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) face.
``No!'' Mrs. Weasley moaned. ``No... riddikulus! Riddikulus! RIDDlKULUS''
Crack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead Harry...
``Mrs. Weasley, just get out of here!'' shouted Harry, staring down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own dead body on the
floor. ``Let someone else -''
``Whats going on?''
Lupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius, with Moody stumping along
behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs. Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to
understand in an instant. Pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own wand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, very firmly and clearly:
``Riddikulus!''
Harrys body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain. Lupin
waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke.
``Oh - oh - oh!'' gulped Mrs. Weasley, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) broke into a storm of crying, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hands.
``Molly,'' said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>). ``Molly dont...''
Next second, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was sobbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) heart out on Lupins shoulder.
``Molly, it was just a Boggart,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) said soothingly, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) on the head, ``just a stupid
Boggart...''
``I see them d-d - dead all the time!'' Mrs. Weasley moaned into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) shoulder. ``All thet -t - time!
I d - d - dream about it...''
Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the Boggart, pretending to be Harrys body, had
lain. Moody was looking at Harry, who avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gaze. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a funny feeling Moodys
magical eye had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) all the way out of the kitchen.
``D-d - dont tell Arthur,'' Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) eyes frantically with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
cuffs. ``I d - d - dont want him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to know... being silly...''
Lupin handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) a handkerchief and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) blew her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) nose.
``Harry, Im so sorry. What must you think of me?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said shakily. ``Not even able to get rid of a Boggart...''
``Dont be stupid,'' said Harry, trying to smile.
``Im justs -s - so worried,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, tears spilling out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) eyes again. ``Half the f - f - familys in the Order, itll b - b - be a miracle if we all come through this... and P - P - Percys not talking to us... what if something d-d - dreadful happens and weve never m - m - made it up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)? And whats going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, whos g - g - going to look after Ron and Ginny?''
``Molly thats enough'' said Lupin firmly. ``This isnt like last time. The Order are better prepared, weve got a head start, we know what Voldemorts up to -''
Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.
``Oh, Molly, come on, its about time you got used to hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) name - look, I cant promise no
ones going to get hurt, nobody can promise that, but were much better off than we were last
time. You werent in the Order then, you dont understand. Last time we were outnumbered
twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one...''
Harry thought of the photograph again, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parents beaming faces. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew Moody was still
watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Dont worry about Percy'' said Sirius abruptly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)ll come round. Its only a matter of time
before Voldemort moves into the open; once he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) does, the whole Ministrys going to be begging
us to forgive them. And Im not sure Ill be accepting their apology,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) added bitterly.
``And as for whos going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died,'' said Lupin,
smiling slightly, ``what do you think wed do, let them starve?''
Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously.
``Being silly,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) muttered again, mopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) eyes.
But Harry, closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedroom door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs.
Weasley silly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could still see his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parents beaming up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from the tattered old photograph,
unaware that their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close. The image
of the Boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs. Weasleys family in turn kept
flashing before his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) eyes.
Without warning, the scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) forehead seared with pain again and his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) stomach churned
horribly.
``Cut it out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded.
``First sign of madness, talking to your own head,<div class="bookquote">'' said a sly voice from the empty picture on the
wall.
Harry ignored it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ever felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life and it seemed extraordinary to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
that barely an hour ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a prefects badge.
CHAPTER TEN
Luna Lovegood
Harry had a troubled nights sleep. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parents wove in and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dreams, never speaking;
Mrs. Weasley sobbed over Kreachers dead body, watched by Ron and Hermione who were
wearing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked
door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) awoke abruptly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar prickling to find Ron already dressed and talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>... better hurry up, Mums going ballistic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) says were going to miss the train.<div class="bookquote">''
There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dressed at top speed,
Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the
bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)
down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs. Black and Mrs. Weasley were both screaming at the
top of their voices.
'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>- COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU IDIOTS -<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>IDIOTS</b></font>)</div>- FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS -''
Hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered, just as Harry was putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
trainers. Hedwig was swaying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) shoulder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) arms.
``Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back.'' The owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) cage. ``Are you ready yet?''
``Nearly. Is Ginny all right?'' Harry asked, shoving on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses.
``Mrs. Weasleys patched her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) up,'' said Hermione. ``But now Mad-Eyes complaining that we
cant leave unless Sturgis Podmores here, otherwise the guard will be one short.
<div class="bookquote">``Guard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``We have to go to Kings Cross with a guard?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have to go to Kings Cross with a guard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione corrected him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry irritably. <div class="bookquote">``I thought Voldemort was supposed to be lying low, or are you
telling me he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont know, its just what Mad-Eye says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione distractedly, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) watch,
<div class="bookquote">``but if we dont leave soon were definitely going to miss the train...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room. Harry seized Hedwig, stuffed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) unceremoniously into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) cage, and set off downstairs after Hermione, dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk.
Mrs. Blacks portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>); all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) again, anyway.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, youre to come with me and Tonks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>shouted Mrs. Weasley - over the repeated screeches
of <div class="bookquote">``MUDBLOODS! SCUM! CREATURES OF DIRT!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>- <div class="bookquote">``Leave your trunk and your owl,
Alastors going to deal with the luggage... oh, for heavens sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>A dog</b></font>)</div>A bear-like black dog had appeared at Harrys side as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was clambering over the various trunks
cluttering the hall to get to Mrs. Weasley.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh honestly...''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasley despairingly. ``Well, on your own head be it!
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak September sunlight. Harry and
the dog followed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). The door slammed behind them and Mrs. Blacks screeches were cut off
instantly.
``Wheres Tonks?'' Harry said, looking round as they went down the stone steps of number twelve, which vanished the moment they reached the pavement.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Blacks</b></font>)s waiting for us just up here,'' said Mrs. Weasley stiffly, averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) eyes from the
lolloping black dog beside Harry.
An old woman greeted them on the corner. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had tightly curled grey hair and wore a purple hat
shaped like a pork pie.
``Wotcher, Harry,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, winking. ``Better hurry up, hadnt we, Molly?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, checking
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) watch.
``I know, I know,'' moaned Mrs. Weasley, lengthening her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) stride, ``but Mad-Eye wanted to wait
for Sturgis... if only Arthur could have got us cars from the Ministry again... but Fudge wont
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days... how Muggles can stand traveling
without magic.''
But the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gamboled around them, snapping at pigeons and
chasing its own tail. Harry couldnt help laughing. Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long
time. Mrs. Weasley pursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) lips in an almost Aunt Petunia-ish way.
It took them twenty minutes to reach Kings Cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened
during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats for Harrys entertainment. Once inside the
station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast
was clear, then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine
and three-quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform
packed with departing students and their families. Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
spirits soar... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was really going back...
``I hope the others make it in time,'' said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) at the
wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which new arrivals would come.
``Nice dog, Harry!'' called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
``Thanks, Lee,'' said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tail frantically.
``Oh good,'' said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, ``heres Alastor with the luggage, look...''
A porters cap pulled low over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mismatched eyes, Moody came limping through the archway
pushing a trolley loaded with their trunks.
``All okay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks, ``dont think we were followed...''
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged on to the platform with Ron and Hermione. They had
almost unloaded Moodys luggage trolley when Fred, George and Ginny turned up with Lupin.
``No trouble?'' growled Moody.
``Nothing,'' said Lupin.
``Ill still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,'' said Moody, ``thats the second time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s not
turned up in a week. Getting as unreliable as Mundungus.''
``Well, look after yourselves,'' said Lupin, shaking hands all round. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) reached Harry last and
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a clap on the shoulder. ``You too Harry. Be careful.''
``Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,'' said Moody, shaking Harrys hand too.
``And dont forget, all of you - careful what you put in writing. If in doubt, dont put it in a letter at all.''
``Its been great meeting all of you,'' said Tonks, hugging Hermione and Ginny ``Well see you
soon, I expect.''
A warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform started hurrying on to the train.
``Quick, quick,'' said Mrs. Weasley distractedly, hugging them at random and catching Harry
twice. ``Write... be good... if youve forgotten anything well send it on... on to the train, now,
hurry...''
For one brief moment, the great black dog reared on to its hind legs and placed its front paws on
Harrys shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley shoved Harry away towards the train door, hissing, ``For
heavens sake, act more like a dog, Sirius!''
``See you!'' Harry called out of the open window as the train began to move, while Ron,
Hermione and Ginny waved beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). The figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody and Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wagging its tail;
blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train, then they rounded a
bend, and Sirius was gone.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shouldnt have come with us,'' said Hermione in a worried voice.
``Oh, lighten up,'' said Ron, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hasnt seen daylight for months, poor bloke.''
``Well,'' said Fred, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hands together, ``cant stand around chatting all day, weve got
business to discuss with Lee. See you later,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) and George disappeared down the corridor to
the right.
The train was gathering still more speed, so that the houses outside the window flashed past, and
they swayed where they stood.
``Shall we go and find a compartment, then?'' Harry asked.
Ron and Hermione exchanged looks.
``Er,'' said Ron.
``Were - well - Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect carriage,'' Hermione said
awkwardly.
Ron wasnt looking at Harry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left hand.
``Oh,'' said Harry. ``Right. Fine.''
``I dont think well have to stay there all journey,'' said Hermione quickly. ``Our letters said we
just get instructions from the Head Boy and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time.''
``Fine,'' said Harry again. ``Well, I - I might see you later, then.''
``Yeah, definitely,'' said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry. ``Its a pain having to go
down there, Id rather - but we have to -I mean, Im not enjoying it, Im not Percy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finished
defiantly.
``I know youre not,'' said Harry and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grinned. But as Hermione and Ron dragged their trunks,
Crookshanks and a caged Pigwidgeon off towards the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd
sense of loss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron.
``Come on,'' Ginny told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), ``if we get a move on well be able to save them places.''
``Right,'' said Harry, picking up Hedwigs cage in one hand and the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk in the
other. They struggled off down the corridor, peering through the glass-paneled doors into the
compartments they passed, which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a lot of
people stared back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbors
and pointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had met this behavior in five consecutive carriages he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wondered dully whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories.
In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harrys fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
round face shining with the effort of pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) struggling toad, Trevor.
``Hi, Harry'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) panted. ``Hi, Ginny... everywheres full... I cant find a seat...''
``What are you talking about?'' said Ginny, who had squeezed past Neville to peer into the
compartment behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>). ``Theres room in this one, theres only Loony Lovegood in here --''
Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone.
``Dont be silly,'' said Ginny, laughing, ``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)s all right.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) slid the door open and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) trunk inside. Harry and Neville followed.
``Hi, Luna,'' said Ginny, ``is it okay if we take these seats?''
The girl beside the window looked up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) had straggly, waist-length, dirty blonde hair, very
pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at
once why Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an aura of distinct
dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had stuck her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wand behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left ear for safekeeping,
or that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had chosen to wear a necklace of Butterbeer corks, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was reading a
magazine upside-down. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nodded.
``Thanks,'' said Ginny, smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>).
Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwigs cage in the luggage rack and sat down.
Luna watched them over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) did not
seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) stared and stared at Harry, who had taken
the seat opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) and now wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadnt.
``Had a good summer, Luna?'' Ginny asked.
``Yes,'' said Luna dreamily, without taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) eyes off Harry. ``Yes, it was quite enjoyable, you
know. Youre Harry Potter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) added.
``I know I am,'' said Harry.
Neville chuckled. Luna turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) pale eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) instead.
``And I dont know who you are.''
``Im nobody,'' said Neville hurriedly.
``No youre not,'' said Ginny sharply. ``Neville Longbottom - Luna Lovegood. Lunas in my year, but in Ravenclaw.''
``Wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure,'' said Luna in a singsong voice.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) upside-down magazine high enough to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) face and fell silent. Harry and
Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle.
The train rattled onwards, speeding them out into open country. It was an odd, unsettled sort of
day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath
ominously grey clouds.
``Guess what I got for my birthday?'' said Neville.
``Another Remembrall?'' said Harry, remembering the marble-like device Nevilles grandmother
had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) in an effort to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) abysmal memory.
``No,'' said Neville. ``I could do with one, though, I lost the old one ages ago... no, look at this...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) schoolbag and after a little
bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot, except that it was
covered with what looked like boils rather than spines.
``Mimbulus mimbletonia,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) said proudly.
Harry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather sinister look of some
diseased internal organ.
``Its really, really rare,'' said Neville, beaming. ``I dont know if theres one in the greenhouse at
Hogwarts, even. I cant wait to show it to Professor Sprout. My Great Uncle Algie got it for me
in Assyria. Im going to see if I can breed from it.''
Harry knew that Nevilles favorite subject was Herbology but for the life of him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) could not
see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) would want with this stunted little plant.
``Does it - er - do anything?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) asked.
``Loads of stuff!'' said Neville proudly. ``Its got an amazing defensive mechanism. Here, hold
Trevor for me...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) dumped the toad into Harrys lap and took a quill from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) schoolbag. Luna Lovegoods
popping eyes appeared over the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) upside-down magazine again, to watch what Neville
was doing. Neville held the Mimbulus mimbletonia up t o his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) tongue between his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) teeth,
chose his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) quill.
Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant; thick, stinking, dark green jets of it. They hit the
ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegoods magazine; Ginny, who had flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) arms
up in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) face just in time, merely looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) was wearing a slimy green hat,
but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing Trevors escape, received a faceful. It smelled
like rancid manure.
Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) head to get the worst out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
eyes.
``S - sorry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) gasped. ``I havent tried that before... didnt realize it would be quite so... dont
worry, though, Stinksaps not poisonous,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful on to the floor.
At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open.
``Oh... hello, Harry,'' said a nervous voice. ``Um... bad time?''
Harry wiped the lenses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Trevor-free hand. A very pretty girl with long,
shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>): Cho Chang, the Seeker on the
Ravenclaw Quidditch team.
``Oh... hi,'' said Harry blankly.
``Um...'' said Cho. ``Well... just thought Id say hello... bye then.''
Rather pink in the face, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) closed the door and departed. Harry slumped back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seat and
groaned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have liked Cho to discover him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sitting with a group of very cool people
laughing their heads off at a joke he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just told; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would not have chosen to be sitting with
Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.
``Never mind,'' said Ginny bracingly. ``Look, we can easily get rid of all this.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) pulled out her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)
wand. ``Scourgify!''
The Stinksap vanished.
``Sorry,'' said Neville again, in a small voice.
Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already
gone by. Harry, Ginny and Neville had finished their pumpkin pasties and were busy swapping
Chocolate Frog Cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied
by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cage.
``Im starving,'' said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from
Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ripped open the wrapper, bit off the
frogs head and leaned back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes closed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had had a very exhausting
morning.
``Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each house,'' said Hermione, looking thoroughly
disgruntled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) seat. ``Boy and girl from each.''
``And guess whos a Slytherin prefect?'' said Ron, still with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes closed.
``Malfoy,'' replied Harry at once, certain his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) worst fear would be confirmed.
``Course,'' said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth and taking another.
``And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,'' said Hermione viciously. ``How she (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) got to be a prefect when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>)s thicker than a concussed troll...''
``Whos Hufflepuff?'' Harry asked.
``Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,'' said Ron thickly.
``And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,'' said Hermione.
``You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,'' said a vague voice.
Everyone turned to look at Luna Lovegood, who was gazing unblinkingly at Ron over the top of
The Quibbler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouthful of Frog.
``Yeah, I know I did,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, looking mildly surprised.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) didnt enjoy it very much,'' Luna informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>). ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) doesnt think you treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) very
well, because you wouldnt dance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>). I dont think Id have minded,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) added
thoughtfully, ``I dont like dancing very much.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) retreated behind The Quibbler again. Ron stared at the cover with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth hanging open
for a few seconds, then looked around at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had
stuffed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) knuckles in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) mouth to stop herself giggling. Ron shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head, bemused, then
checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) watch.
``Were supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) told Harry and Neville, ``and we can
give out punishments if people are misbehaving. I cant wait to get Crabbe and Goyle for
something.''
``Youre not supposed to abuse your position, Ron!'' said Hermione sharply.
``Yeah, right, because Malfoy wont abuse it at all,'' said Ron sarcastically.
``So youre going to descend to his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) level?''
``No, Im just going to make sure I get his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) mates before he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) gets mine.''
``For heavens sake, Ron -''
``Ill make Goyle do lines, itll kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hates writing,'' said Ron happily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) voice to Goyles low grunt and, screwing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. ``I... must... not... look... like... a... baboons... backside.''
Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Lovegood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) let out a scream of
mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up
into the luggage rack, hissing. Luna laughed so hard her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) magazine slipped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) grasp, slid
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) legs and on to the floor.
``That was funny!''
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) prominent eyes swam with tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) gasped for breath, staring at Ron. Utterly nonplussed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked around at the others, who were now laughing at the expression on Rons face and at
the ludicrously prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backwards and
forwards, clutching her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) sides.
``Are you taking the mickey?'' said Ron, frowning at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>).
``Baboons... backside!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) choked, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) ribs.
Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry glancing at the magazine on the floor,
noticed something that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dive for it. Upside-down it had been hard to tell what the
picture on the front was, but Harry now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius Fudge;
Harry only recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) because of the lime-green bowler hat. One of Fudges hands was
clenched around a bag of gold; the other hand was throttling a goblin. The cartoon was
captioned: How Far Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts?
Beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine.
Corruption in the Quidditch League:
How the Tornados are Taking Control
Secrets of the Ancient Runes Revealed
Sirius Black: Villain or Victim?
``Can I have a look at this?'' Harry asked Luna eagerly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with laughter.
Harry opened the magazine and scanned the index. Until this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had completely
forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed Mr. Weasley to give to Sirius, but it must have been
this edition of The Quibbler.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) found the page, and turned excitedly to the article.
This, too, was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon; in fact, Harry would not have known it was
supposed to be Sirius if it hadnt been captioned. Sirius was standing on a pile of human bones
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wand out. The headline on the article said:
SIRIUS - BLACK AS HE (<font color='blue'><b>SIRIUS</b></font>)S PAINTED?
Notorious mass murderer or innocent singing sensation?
Harry had to read this first sentence several times before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not
misunderstood it. Since when had Sirius been a singing sensation?
For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent
Muggles and one wizard. Blacks audacious escape from Azkaban two years ago has led to the
widest manhunt ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic. None of us has ever questioned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the Dementors.
BUT DOES HE (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)?
Startling new evidence has recently come to light that Sirius Black may not have committed the
crimes for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) was sent to Azkaban. In fact, says Doris Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little
Norton, Black may not even have been present at the killings.
``What people dont realize is that Sirius Black is a false name,'' says Mrs. Purkiss. ``The man
people believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Boardman, lead singer of popular singing group The Hobgoblins, who retired fro m public life after being struck on the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Norton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago. I recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>) the moment I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>) picture in the paper. Now, Stubby couldnt possibly have committed those crimes, because on the day in question he (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>) happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me. I have written to the Minister for Magic and am expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) to give Stubby, alias - Sirius, a full pardon any day now.''
Harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief. Perhaps it was a joke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought,
perhaps the magazine often printed spoof Hems. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flicked back a few pages and found the
piece on Fudge.
Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, denied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) had any plans to take over the running of the Wizarding Bank, Gringotts, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) was elected Minister for Magic five years ago. Fudge
has always insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) wants nothing more than to co-operate peacefully with the guardians of our gold.
BUT DOES HE (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>)?
Sources close to the Minister have recently disclosed that Fudges dearest ambition is to seize
control of the goblin gold supplies and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) will not hesitate to use force if need be.
``It wouldnt be the first time, either,'' said a Ministry insider. ``Cornelius Goblin-Crusher Fudge, thats what his (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>) friends call him (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>). If you could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>) thinks no ones listening, oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>)s always talking about the goblins he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>)s had done in; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>)s had them drowned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>)s had them dropped off buildings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>)s had them poisoned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>)s had them cooked in pies...''
Harry did not read any further. Fudge might have many faults but Harry found it extremely hard
to imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ordering goblins to be cooked in pies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flicked through the rest of the
magazine. Pausing every few pages, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) read: an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were
winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal broom-tampering and
torture; an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six
and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes which at least
explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler upside-down. According to the magazine, if
you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemys ears turn into
kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The Quibbler, the suggestion that Sirius
might really be the lead singer of The Hobgoblins was quite sensible.
``Anything good in there?'' asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine.
``Of course not,'' said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer. ``The Quibblers rubbish,
everyone knows that.''
``Excuse me,'' said Luna; her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality. ``My fathers the editor.''
``I - oh,'' said Hermione, looking embarrassed. ``Well, its got some interesting... I mean, its
quite...''
``Ill have it back, thank you,'' said Luna coldly, and leaning forwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) snatched it out of
Harrys hands. Riffling through it to page fifty-seven, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) turned it resolutely upside-down again
and disappeared behind it, just as the compartment door opened for the third time.
Harry looked around; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had expected this, but that did not make the sight of Draco Malfoy
smirking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) from between his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) cronies Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable.
``What?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) mouth.
``Manners, Potter, or Ill have to give you a detention,'' drawled Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair
and pointed chin were just like his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) fathers. ``You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect,
which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.''
``Yeah,'' said Harry, ``but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.''
Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville laughed. Malfoys lip curled.
``Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) asked.
``Shut up, Malfoy,'' said Hermione sharply.
``I seem to have touched a nerve,'' said Malfoy, smirking. ``Well, just watch yourself, Potter,
because Ill be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line.''
``Get out!'' said Hermione, standing up.
Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed, with Crabbe and Goyle
lumbering along in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) wake. Hermione slammed the compartment door behind them and turned
to look at Harry, who knew at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), had registered what Malfoy had said and
been just as unnerved by it.
``Chuck us another Frog,'' said Ron, who had clearly noticed nothing.
Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) exchanged another nervous look
with Hermione, then stared out of the window.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had thought Sirius coming with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) to the station was a bit of a laugh, but suddenly it seemed
reckless, if not downright dangerous... Hermione had been right... Sirius should not have come.
What if Mr. Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco? What if he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had deduced that the
Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding? Or had Malfoys use of the
word dogging been a coincidence?
The weather remained undecided as they traveled further and further north. Rain spattered the
windows in a half-hearted way, then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over
it once more. When darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna rolled up The
Quibbler, put it carefully away in her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) bag and took to staring at everyone in the compartment
instead.
Harry was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead pressed against the train window, trying to get a first distant
glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy.
``Wed better change,'' said Hermione at last, and all of them opened their trunks with difficulty
and pulled on their school robes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and Ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their
chests. Harry saw Ron checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reflection in the black window.
At last, the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as
everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled, ready to get off. As Ron and
Hermione were supposed to supervise all this, they disappeared from the carriage again, leaving
Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.
``Ill carry that owl, if you like, '' said Luna to Harry, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as Neville
stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket.
``Oh - er - thanks, '' said Harry, handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) the cage and hoisting Hedwigs more securely into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms.
They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they
joined the crowd in the corridor. Slowly, they moved towards the doors. Harry could smell the
pine trees that lined the path down to the lake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stepped down on to the platform and looked
around, listening for the familiar call of ``firs-years over ere... firs-years...''
But it did not come. Instead, a quite different voice, a brisk female one, was calling out, ``First years line up over here, please! All first-years to me!''
A lantern came swinging towards Harry and by its light he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw the prominent chin and severe
haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the witch who had taken over Hagrids Care of Magical
Creatures lessons for a while the previous year.
``Wheres Hagrid?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said out loud.
``I dont know,'' said Ginny, ``but wed better get out of the way, were blocking the door.''
``Oh, yeah...''
Harry and Ginny became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the
station. Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had to be here, Harry had been relying on it - seeing Hagrid again was one of the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d
been looking forward to most. But there was no sign of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cant have left, Harry told himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway on to the
road outside with the rest of the crowd. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s just got a cold or something...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around for Ron or Hermione, wanting to know what they thought about the
reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of them was anywhere near him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), so he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
allowed himself to be shunted forwards on to the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade
Station.
Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first
year up to the castle. Harry glanced quickly at them, turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and
Hermione, then did a double-take.
The coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures standing between the carriage
shafts. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had had to give them a name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have called them horses, though
there was something reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their black coats
clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible. Their heads were dragonish, and
their pupil-less eyes white and staring. Wings sprouted from each wither - vast, black leathery
wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats. Standing still and quiet in the
gathering gloom, the creatures looked eerie and sinister. Harry could not understand why the
coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving
along by themselves.
``Wheres Pig?'' said Rons voice, right behind Harry.
``That Luna girl was carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>),'' said Harry, turning quickly, eager to consult Ron about
Hagrid. ``Where dyou reckon -<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>- Hagrid is? I dunno,'' said Ron, sounding worried. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>)d better be okay...''
A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of cronies including Crabbe,
Goyle and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timid-looking second-years out of the way so that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) friends could get a coach to themselves. Seconds later, Hermione emerged panting
from the crowd.
``Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first-year back there. I swear Im going to report him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)s only had his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) badge three minutes and he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)s using it to bully people worse than ever...
wheres Crookshanks?''
``Ginnys got him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>),'' said Harry. ``There she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) is...''
Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming Crookshanks.
``Thanks,'' said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. ``Come on, lets get a carriage together
before they all fill up...''
``I havent got Pig yet!'' Ron said, but Hermione was already heading off towards the nearest
unoccupied coach. Harry remained behind with Ron.
``What are those things, dyou reckon?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked Ron, nodding at the horrible horses as the other
students surged past them.
``What things?''
``Those horse -''
Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeons cage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) arms; the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as
usual.
``Here you are,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)s a sweet little owl, isnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)?''
``Er... yeah... he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)s all right,'' said Ron gruffly. ``Well, come on then, lets get in... what were you
saying, Harry?''
``I was saying, what are those horse things?'' Harry said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Ron and Luna made for the
carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already sitting.
``What horse things?''
``The horse things pulling the carriages!'' said Harry impatiently. They were, after all, about three
feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave
Harry a perplexed look.
``What are you talking about?''
``Im talking about - look!''
Harry grabbed Rons arm and wheeled him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) about so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was face to face with the winged
horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at Harry.
``What am I supposed to be looking at?''
``At the - there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! Its right there in front -''
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to Harry.
``Cant... cant you see them?''
``See what?''
``Cant you see whats pulling the carriages?''
Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
``Are you feeling all right, Harry?''
``I... yeah...''
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was there in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), gleaming solidly in the dim
light issuing from the station windows behind them, vapour rising from its nostrils in the chilly
night air. Yet, unless Ron was faking - and it was a very feeble joke if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was - Ron could not see
it at all.
``Shall we get in, then?'' said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as though worried about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).
``Yeah,'' said Harry. ``Yeah, go on...''
``Its all right,'' said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron vanished into the coachs dark
interior. ``Youre not going mad or anything. I can see them, too.''
``Can you?'' said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see the bat-winged horses reflected in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wide silvery eyes.
``Oh, yes,'' said Luna, ``Ive been able to see them ever since my first day here. Theyve always
pulled the carriages. Dont worry. Youre just as sane as I am''
Smiling faintly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after Ron. Not altogether
reassured, Harry followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Sorting Hats New Song
Harry did not want to tell the others that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Luna were having the same hallucination, if that
was what it was, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said nothing more about the horses as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat down inside the carriage and
slammed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not help watching the silhouettes of the
horses moving beyond the window.
``Did everyone see that Grubbly-Plank woman?'' asked Ginny. ``Whats she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doing back here?
Hagrid cant have left, can he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)?''
``Ill be quite glad if he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) has,'' said Luna, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) isnt a very good teacher, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)?''
``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) is!'' said Harry, Ron and Ginny angrily.
Harry glared at Hermione. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) throat and quickly said, ``Erm... yes... he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)s very
good.''
``Well, we in Ravenclaw think he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)s a bit of a joke,'' said Luna, unfazed.
``Youve got a rubbish sense of humor then,'' Ron snapped, as the wheels below them creaked
into motion.
Luna did not seem perturbed by Rons rudeness; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) simply watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) for a
while as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) were a mildly interesting television program.
Rattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road. When they passed between the
tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds,
Harry leaned forwards to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrids cabin by the
Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete darkness. Hogwarts Castle, however,
loomed ever closer: a towering mass of turrets, jet black against the dark sky, here and there a
window blazing fiery bright above them.
The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and Harry
got out of the carriage first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned again to look for lit windows down by the Forest, but there
was definitely no sign of life within Hagrids cabin. Unwillingly, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had half-hoped they
would have vanished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes instead upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing
quietly in the chill night air, their blank white eyes gleaming.
Harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that Ron could not, but that had
been a reflection in a mirror, something much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid looking beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages. If Luna was to be believed, the beasts
had always been there but invisible. Why, then, could Harry suddenly see them, and why could
Ron not?
``Are you coming or what'' said Ron beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).
``Oh... yeah,'' said Harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the
castle.
The Entrance Hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the
flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term feast.
The four long house tables in the Great Hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling,
which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows. Candles floated in
midair all along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the Hall and
the faces of the students talking eagerly, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends
from other houses, eyeing one anothers new haircuts and robes. Again, Harry noticed people
putting their heads together to whisper as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gritted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) teeth and tried to act as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neither noticed nor cared.
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they reached Gryffindors,
Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth-years and left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione
and Neville found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick,
the Gryffindor house ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave
Harry airy, overly-friendly greetings that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quite sure they had stopped talking about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a split second before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had more important things to worry about, however: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
looking over the students heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)s not there.''
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real need; Hagrids size
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) instantly obvious in any lineup.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) cant have left,'' said Ron, sounding slightly anxious.
``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) hasnt,'' said Harry firmly.
``You dont think he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)s... hurt, or anything, do you?'' said Hermione uneasily.
``No,'' said Harry at once.
``But where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>), then?''
There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville, Parvati and Lavender could not
hear, ``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)s not back yet. You know - from his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) mission - the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) was doing over the
summer for Dumbledore.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah... yeah, thatll be it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, sounding reassured, but Hermione bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lip, looking up
and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrids absence.
<div class="bookquote">``Whos that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said sharply, pointing towards the middle of the staff table.
Harrys eyes followed hers. They lit first upon Professor Dumbledore, sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) high-backed
golden chair at the center of the long staff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery
stars and a matching hat. Dumbledores head was inclined towards the woman sitting next to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), who was talking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) ear. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked, Harry thought, like somebodys maiden aunt:
squat, with short, curly, mouse-brown hair in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had placed a horrible pink Alice band
that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wore over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) robes. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face slightly
to take a sip from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) goblet and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw, with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a
pair of prominent, pouchy eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Its that Umbridge woman!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was at my hearing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) works for Fudge!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nice cardigan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, smirking.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) works for Fudge!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione repeated, frowning. <div class="bookquote">``What on earths she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) doing here, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dunno...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione scanned the staff table, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes narrowed.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) muttered, <div class="bookquote">``no, surely not...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Harry did not understand what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was talking about but did not ask; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) attention had been
caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) worked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Hagrids. That meant the
first-years must have crossed the lake and reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds
later, the doors from the Entrance Hall opened. A long line of scared-looking first-years entered,
led by Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizards hat,
heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim.
The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The first-years lined up in front of the staff table
facing the rest of the students, and Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of
them, then stood back.
The first-years faces glowed palely in the candlelight. A small boy right in the middle of the row
looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was trembling. Harry recalled, fleetingly, how terrified he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had felt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had stood there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which house he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) belonged.
The whole school waited with bated breath. Then the rip near the hats brim opened wide like a
mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into song:
In times of old when I was new,
And Hogwarts barely started,
The founders of our noble school,
Thought never to be parted,
United by a common goal,
They had the selfsame yearning,
To make the worlds best magic school,
And pass along their learning.
<div class="bookquote">``Together we will build and teach!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The friends</b></font>)</div>The four good friends decided,
And never did they dream,
That they might some day be divided,
For were there such friends anywhere,
As Slytherin and Gryffindor?
Unless it was the second pair
Of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw?
So how could it have gone so wrong?
How could such friendships fail?
Why, I was there and so can tell,
The whole sad, sorry tale.
Said Slytherin, <div class="bookquote">``Well teach just those whose
Ancestry is purest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Said Slytherin</b></font>)</div>Said Ravenclaw, <div class="bookquote">``Well teach those whose
Intelligence is surest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Said Ravenclaw</b></font>)</div>Said Gryffindor, <div class="bookquote">``Well teach all those
With brave deeds to their name.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Said Gryffindor</b></font>)</div>Said Hufflepuff, <div class="bookquote">``Ill teach the lot,
And treat them just the same.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Said Hufflepuff</b></font>)</div>These differences caused little strife,
When first they came to light,
For each of the four founders had
A house in which they might
Take only those they wanted,
So, for instance, Slytherin
Took only pure-blood wizards
Of great cunning, just like him (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>),
And only those of sharpest mind
Were taught by Ravenclaw
While the bravest and the boldest
Went to daring Gryffindor.
Good Hufflepuff, she (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) took the rest,
And taught them all she (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) knew,
Thus the houses and their founders
Retained friendships firm and true.
So Hogwarts worked in harmony
For several happy years,
But then discord crept among us
Feeding on our faults and fears.
The houses that, like pillars four,
Had once held up our school,
Now turned upon each other and,
Divided, sought to rule.
And for a while it seemed the school
Must meet an early end,
What with dueling and with fighting
And the clash of friend on friend
And at last there came a morning
When old Slytherin departed
And though the fighting then died out
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) left us quite downhearted.
And never since the founders four
Were whittled down to three
Have the houses been united
As they once were meant to be.
And now the Sorting Hat is here
And you all know the score:
I sort you into houses
Because that is what Im for,
But this year Ill go further,
Listen closely to my song:
Though condemned I am to split you
Still I worry that its wrong,
Though I must fulfill my duty
And must quarter every year
Still I wonder whether Sorting
May not bring the end I fear.
Oh, know the perils, read the signs,
The warning history shows,
For our Hogwarts is in danger
From external, deadly foes
And we must unite inside her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
Or well crumble from within
I have told you, I have warned you...
Let the Sorting now begin.
The Hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though it was punctured, for the first
time in Harrys memory, with muttering and whispers. All across the Great Hall students were
exchanging remarks with their neighbors, and Harry, clapping along with everyone else, knew
exactly what they were talking about.
<div class="bookquote">``Branched out a bit this year, hasnt it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyebrows raised.
<div class="bookquote">``Too right it has,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the different qualities looked for by each of
the four Hogwarts houses and its own role in Sorting them. Harry could not remember it ever
trying to give the school advice before.
<div class="bookquote">``I wonder if its ever given warnings before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, sounding slightly anxious.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/NICK</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning across Neville towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
-LRB-Neville winced; it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``The Hat feels
itself honor-bound to give the school due warning whenever it feels -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of first-years names, was giving
the whispering students the sort of look that scorches. Nearly Headless Nick placed a see-through finger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end.
With a last frowning look that swept the four house tables, Professor McGonagall lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) long piece of parchment and called out the first name.
<div class="bookquote">``Abercrombie, Euan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>The terrified-looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled forwards and put the Hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
head; it was only prevented from falling right down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulders by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very prominent ears.
The Hat considered for a moment, then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted:
<div class="bookquote">``Gryffindor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor house as Euan Abercrombie staggered to their
table and sat down, looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Abercrombie</b></font>) would like very much to sink through the floor and
never be looked at again.
Slowly, the long line of first-years thinned. In the pauses between the names and the Sorting
Hats decisions, Harry could hear Rons stomach rumbling loudly. Finally, <div class="bookquote">``Zeller, Rose''  (<font color='red'><b>Hufflepuff</b></font>)</div>was
Sorted into Hufflepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the Hat and stool and marched
them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) feet.
Whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) recent bitter feelings had been towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) Headmaster, Harry was somehow
soothed to see Dumbledore standing before them all. Between the absence of Hagrid and the
presence of those dragonish horses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated,
was full of unexpected surprises, like jarring notes in a familiar song. But this, at least, was how
it was supposed to be: their Headmaster rising to greet them all before the start-of-term feast.
<div class="bookquote">``To our newcomers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) lips, <div class="bookquote">``welcome! To our old hands - welcome back! There is a time for speechmaking, but this is not it. Tuck in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and
threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) long beard over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) plate - for food had
appeared out of nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and
dishes of vegetables, bread and sauces and flagons of pumpkin juice.
<div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) seized the nearest plate of chops
and began piling them on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) plate, watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick.
<div class="bookquote">``What were you saying before the Sorting?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked the ghost. <div class="bookquote">``About the Hat giving
warnings?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/NICK</b></font>)</div>said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from Ron, who was now eating
roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have heard the Hat give several warnings
before, always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school. And always, of
course, its advice is the same: stand together, be strong from within.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an achievement for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to make any noise at
all.
<div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/NICK</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick politely, while Hermione looked revolted. Ron
gave an enormous swallow and said, <div class="bookquote">``How can it know if the schools in danger if its a Hat?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have no idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/NICK</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, it lives in Dumbledores office, so I
daresay it picks things up there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And it wants all the houses to be friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, looking over at the Slytherin table, where
Draco Malfoy was holding court. <div class="bookquote">``Fat chance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, you shouldnt take that attitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/NICK</b></font>)</div>said Nick reprovingly. <div class="bookquote">``Peaceful cooperation,
thats the key. We ghosts, though we belong to separate houses, maintain links of friendship. In
spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of seeking
an argument with the Bloody Baron.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only because youre terrified of him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted.
<div class="bookquote">``Terrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never been guilty of cowardice in
my life! The noble blood that runs in my veins -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What blood?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Surely you havent still got -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its a figure of speech!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/NICK</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick, now so annoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) head was trembling
ominously on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) partially severed neck. <div class="bookquote">``I assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of
whichever words I like, even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me! But I am
quite used to students poking fun at my death, I assure you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) wasnt really laughing at you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, throwing a furious look at Ron.
Unfortunately, Rons mouth was packed to exploding point again and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could manage was
<div class="bookquote">``Node iddum eentup sechew,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which Nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology.
Rising into the air, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) straightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end
of the table, coming to rest between the Creevey brothers, Colin and Dennis.
<div class="bookquote">``Well done, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>snapped Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron indignantly, having managed, finally, to swallow his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) food. <div class="bookquote">``Im not allowed to
ask a simple question?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy
silence.
Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt it was a better
use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) time to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way steadily through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) steak and kidney pie, then a large plateful of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) favorite treacle tart.
When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the Hall was starting to creep
upwards again, Dumbledore got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) feet once more. Talking ceased immediately as all turned
to lace the Headmaster. Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) four-poster bed was

<div class="bookquote">``Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your
attention for the usual start-of-term notices,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``First-years ought to know that

know by now, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry Ron Hermione</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged smirks.-RRB-
``Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>) tells me is the four-hundred-and-sixty second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a
number of other things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr.
Filchs office door.
``We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased to welcome back Professor
Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to
introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.''
There was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause, during which Harry, Ron and
Hermione exchanged slightly panicked looks; Dumbledore had not said for how long Grubbly-
Plank would be teaching.
Dumbledore continued, ``Tryouts for the house Quidditch teams will take place on the -''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) broke off, looking enquiringly at Professor Umbridge. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was not much taller standing
than sitting, there was a moment when nobody understood why Dumbledore had stopped talking,
but then Professor Umbridge cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) throat, ``Hem, hem,'' and it became clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had got to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) feet and was intending to make a speech.
Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) sat down smartly and looked alertly
at Professor Umbridge as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) desired nothing better than to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) talk. Other
members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise. Professor Sprouts eyebrows had
disappeared into her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) flyaway hair and Professor McGonagalls mouth was as thin as Harry had
ever seen it. No new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before. Many of the students were
smirking; this woman obviously did not know how things were done at Hogwarts.
``Thank you, Headmaster,'' Professor Umbridge simpered, ``for those kind words of welcome.''
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice was high-pitched, breathy and little-girlish and, again, Harry felt a powerful rush of
dislike that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not explain to himself; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loathed everything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>),
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) stupid voice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) fluffy pink cardigan. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) gave another little throat-clearing cough
-LRB-``hem, hem''-RRB- and continued.
``Well, it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I must say!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) smiled, revealing very pointed teeth.
``And to see such happy little faces looking up at me!''
Harry glanced around. None of the faces he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see looked happy. On the contrary, they all
looked rather taken-aback at being addressed as though they were five years old.
``I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and Im sure well be very good
friends!''
Students exchanged looks at this; some of them were barely concealing grins.
``Ill be her (<font color='blue'><b>teams</b></font>) friend as long as I dont have to borrow that cardigan,'' Parvati whispered to
Lavender, and both of them lapsed into silent giggles.
Professor Umbridge cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) throat again -LRB-``hem, hem''-RRB-, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) continued, some of the
breathiness had vanished from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) sounded much more businesslike and now her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
words had a dull learned-by-heart sound to them.
``The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be
of vital importance. The rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured
and honed by careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be
passed down the generations lest we lose them for ever. The treasure trove of magical knowledge
amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished and polished by those who have been
called to the noble profession of teaching.''
Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) fellow staff members, none of
whom bowed back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). Professor McGonagalls dark eyebrows had contracted so that she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
looked positively hawklike, and Harry distinctly saw her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) exchange a significant glance with
Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little ``hem, hem'' and went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) speech.
``Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and decay. There again, progress for progresss sake must be discouraged, for our
tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A balance, then, between old and new,
between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation...<div class="bookquote">''
Harry found his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) attentiveness ebbing, as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain was slipping in and out of tune. The
quiet that always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put
their heads together, whispering and giggling. Over on the Ravenclaw table Cho Chang was
chatting animatedly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) friends. A few seats along from Cho, Luna Lovegood had got
out The Quibbler again. Meanwhile, at the Hufflepuff table Ernie Macmillan was one of the few
still staring at Professor Umbridge, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was glassy-eyed and Harry was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was only
pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefects badge gleaming on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest.
Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) audience. Harry had the
impression that a full-scale riot could have broken out under her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) nose and she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) would have
ploughed on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) speech. The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and
Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke, though, judging by her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
expression, they were not at all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) taste.
'' (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>... because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time,
to be recognized as errors of judgment. Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly
so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move forward, then, into
a new era of openness, effectiveness and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be
preserved, perfecting what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that
ought to be prohibited.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) sat down. Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) lead, though Harry noticed that
several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping. A few students
joined in, but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not having listened to
more than a few words of it, and before they could start applauding properly, Dumbledore had
stood up again.
``Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illuminating,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said, bowing to her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>). ``Now, as I was saying, Quidditch tryouts will be held...''
``Yes, it certainly was illuminating,'' said Hermione in a low voice.
``Youre not telling me you enjoyed it?'' Ron said quietly, turning a glazed face towards
Hermione. ``That was about the dullest speech Ive ever heard, and I grew up with Percy.''
``I said illuminating, not enjoyable,'' said Hermione. ``It explained a lot.
<div class="bookquote">``Did it''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Sounded like a load of waffle to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione grimly.
<div class="bookquote">``Was there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron blankly.
<div class="bookquote">``How about: progress for progresss sake must be discouraged? How about: pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, what does that mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron impatiently.
<div class="bookquote">``Ill tell you what it means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione through gritted teeth. <div class="bookquote">``It means the Ministrys
interfering at Hogwarts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumbledore had obviously just
dismissed the school, because everyone was standing up ready to leave the Hall. Hermione
jumped up, looking flustered.
<div class="bookquote">``Ron, were supposed to show the first-years where to go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. <div class="bookquote">``Hey - hey, you lot! Midgets!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ron!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, they are, theyre titchy...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know, but you cant call them midgets! - First-years!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione called commandingly along
the table. <div class="bookquote">``This way, please!''
 (<font color='red'><b>students</b></font>)</div>A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables,
all of them trying hard not to lead the group. They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not appeared that young when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had arrived here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grinned at them. A blond boy next
to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified; he (<font color='blue'><b>Abercrombie</b></font>) nudged Euan and whispered something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Abercrombie</b></font>) ear.
Euan Abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt the
grin slide off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face like Stinksap.
<div class="bookquote">``See you later,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said dully to Ron and Hermione and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) way out of the Great Hall
alone, doing everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could to ignore more whispering, staring and pointing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) passed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes fixed ahead as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wove his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) way through the crowd in the Entrance Hall, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of
the crowds behind.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had been stupid not to expect this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) thought angrily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) walked through the much emptier
upstairs corridors. Of course everyone was staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had emerged from the Triwizard
maze two months previously clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have
seen Lord Voldemort return to power. There had not been time last term to explain himself
before theyd all had to go home - even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed
account of the terrible events in that graveyard.
Harry had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common room and come to a halt in
front of the portrait of the Fat Lady before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not know the new password.
<div class="bookquote">``Er...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) pink satin dress
and looked sternly back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``No password, no entrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said loftily.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, I know it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Someone</b></font>)</div>Someone panted up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to see Neville jogging towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Guess what it is? Im actually going to be able to remember it for once -''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) waved the
stunted little cactus he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had shown them on the train. <div class="bookquote">``Mimbulus mimbletonia!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Correct,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fat</b></font>)</div>said the Fat Lady, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) portrait swung open towards them like a door, revealing a
circular hole in the wall behind, through which Harry and Neville now climbed.
The Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever, a cozy circular tower room full of
dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables. A fire was crackling merrily in the grate
and a few people were warming their hands by it before going up to their dormitories; on the
other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning something up on the noticeboard.
Harry waved goodnight to them and headed straight for the door to the boys dormitories; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
not in much of a mood for talking at the moment. Neville followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>).
Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of
covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs. They had been talking as
Harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Harry wondered
whether they had been talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), then whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was being paranoid.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, moving across to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own trunk and opening it.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean/Dean Thomas/Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pajamas in the West Ham colors. <div class="bookquote">``Good
holiday?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>muttered Harry, as a true account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not face it. <div class="bookquote">``You?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, it was okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean</b></font>)</div>chuckled Dean. <div class="bookquote">``Better than Seamuss, anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) was just telling me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, what happened, Seamus?''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville asked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) Mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) bedside cabinet.
Seamus did not answer immediately; he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) was making rather a meal of ensuring that his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) poster of
the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team was quite straight. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) back still turned
to Harry, <div class="bookquote">``Me mam didnt want me to come back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) didnt want me to come back to Hogwarts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>Seamus turned away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) poster and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) own pajamas out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) trunk, still not
looking at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``But - why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, astonished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew that Seamuss mother was a witch and could not
understand, therefore, why she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) should have come over so Dursleyish.
Seamus did not answer until he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) had finished buttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) pajamas.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) said in a measured voice, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose... because of you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart was beating rather fast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>said Seamus again, still avoiding Harrys eye, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>)... er... well, its not just you, its
Dumbledore, too...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) believes the Daily Prophet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) thinks Im a liar and Dumbledores an old
fool?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>Seamus looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, something like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand down on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedside table, pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes, stuffed
them angrily into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk and pulled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pajamas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sick of it; sick of being the person
who was stared at and talked about all the time. If any of them knew, if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to... Mrs. Finnigan had no idea, the stupid woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought savagely.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could do so,
Seamus said, <div class="bookquote">``Look... what did happen that night when... you know, when... with Cedric
Diggory and all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. Dean, who had been bending over his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) trunk
trying to retrieve a slipper, went oddly still and Harry knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was listening hard.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you asking me for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry retorted. <div class="bookquote">``Just read the Daily Prophet like your mother, why dont you? Thatll tell you all you need to know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont you have a go at my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>Seamus snapped.
<div class="bookquote">``Ill have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont talk to me like that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ill talk to you how I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) temper rising so fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) snatched his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand back
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedside table. <div class="bookquote">``If youve got a problem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask
McGonagall if you can be moved... stop your mummy worrying -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Leave my mother out of this, Potter!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whats going on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron had appeared in the doorway. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wide eyes traveled from Harry, who was kneeling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
bed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand pointing at Seamus, to Seamus, who was standing there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) fists raised.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)s having a go at my mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>Seamus yelled.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Harry wouldnt do that -- we met your mother, we liked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, comprehension dawning across his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) freckled face. <div class="bookquote">``Oh... right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venomous look. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>)s right, I dont
want to share a dormitory with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) any more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>)s a madman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats out of order, Seamus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, whose ears were starting to glow red - always a danger
sign.
<div class="bookquote">``Out of order, am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>shouted Seamus, who in contrast with Ron was tuning paler. <div class="bookquote">``You believe all the rubbish he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>)s come out with about You-Know-Who, do you, you reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>)s telling the
truth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``Then youre mad, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>said Seamus in disgust.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah? Well, unfortunately for you, pal, Im also a prefect!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, jabbing himself in the
chest with a finger. <div class="bookquote">``So unless you want detention, watch your mouth!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say
what was going through his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) mind; but with a noise of contempt he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) heel, vaulted
into bed and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and
fell in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and Neville.
<div class="bookquote">``Anyone elses parents got a problem with Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said aggressively.
<div class="bookquote">``My parents are Muggles, mate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean/Dean Thomas/Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Dean, shrugging. <div class="bookquote">``They dont know nothing about no
deaths at Hogwarts, because Im not stupid enough to tell them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You dont know my mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)d weasel anything out of anyone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus/Seamus Finnigan</b></font>)</div>Seamus snapped at him (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Anyway your parents dont get the Daily Prophet. They dont know our Headmasters been
sacked from the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>)s losing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>) marbles -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My gran says thats rubbish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>piped up Neville. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>gran</b></font>) says its the Daily Prophet thats going
downhill, not Dumbledore. She (<font color='blue'><b>gran</b></font>)s cancelled our subscription. We believe Harry''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville
simply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) chin, looking owlishly over them at
Seamus. <div class="bookquote">``My grans always said You-Know-Who would come back one day. She (<font color='blue'><b>gran</b></font>) says if
Dumbledore says he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry felt a rush of gratitude towards Neville. Nobody else said anything. Seamus got out his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>)
wand, repaired the bed hangings and vanished behind them. Dean got into bed, rolled over and
fell silent. Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say either, was gazing fondly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
moonlit cactus.
Harry lay back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pillows while Ron bustled around the next bed, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) things away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
felt shaken by the argument with Seamus, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) had always liked very much. How many
more people were going to suggest that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) was lying, or unhinged?
Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizengamot, then the International
Confederation of Wizards had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) from their ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that
had stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) for months? The two of them were in this
together, after all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) version of events to the whole
school and then to the wider wizarding community. Anyone who thought Harry was a liar had to
think that Dumbledore was, too, or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked...
Theyll know were right in the end, thought Harry miserably, as Ron got into bed and
extinguished the last candle in the dormitory. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wondered how many more attacks like
Seamuss he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) would have to endure before that time came.
CHAPTER TWELVE
Professor Umbridge
Seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before Harry had even put on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) socks.
<div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)ll turn into a nutter if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) stays in a room with me too long?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>asked Harry loudly, as the hem of Seamuss robes whipped out of sight.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont worry about it, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean/Dean Thomas/Thomas</b></font>)</div>Dean muttered, hoisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) schoolbag on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s
just...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dean/Dean Thomas/Thomas</b></font>)</div>But apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) was unable to say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward
pause followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) out of the room.
Neville and Ron both gave Harry an its-his-problem-not-yours look, but Harry was not much
consoled. How much more of this would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) have to take?
<div class="bookquote">``Whats the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>asked Hermione five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all headed towards breakfast. <div class="bookquote">``You look absolutely - Oh for heavens sake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was staring at the common-room noticeboard, where a large new sign had been put up.
GALLONS OF GALLEONS.

<div class="bookquote">``They are the limit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione grimly, taking d own the sign, which Fred and George had
pinned up over a poster giving the date of the first Hogsmeade weekend in October. <div class="bookquote">``Well have to talk to them, Ron.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron looked positively alarmed.
<div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because were prefects!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, as they c l imbed out through the portrait hole. <div class="bookquote">``Its up to us to stop this kind of thing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glum expression that the prospect of stopping Fred
and George doing exactly what they liked was not one he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) found inviting.
<div class="bookquote">``Anyway, whats up, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione continued, as they walked down a flight of stairs lined
with portraits of old witches and wizards, all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their
own conversation. <div class="bookquote">``You look really angry about something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Seamus reckons Harrys lying about You-Know-Who,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron succinctly, when Harry did not respond.
Hermione, who Harry had expected to react angrily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) behalf, sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, Lavender thinks so too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said gloomily.
<div class="bookquote">``Been having a nice little chat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) about whet her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) or not Im a lying, attention-seeking prat,
have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said loudly.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione calmly. <div class="bookquote">``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you havent noticed, Ron and I are on your side.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a short pause.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry in a low voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Thats quite all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione with dignity... Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Dont you
remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Ron both looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) blankly and Hermione sighed again.
<div class="bookquote">``About You-Know-Who. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust --''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you remember stuff like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Ron, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) in admiration.
<div class="bookquote">``I listen, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, with a touch of asperity.
<div class="bookquote">``So do I, but I still couldnt tell you exactly what -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione pressed on loudly, <div class="bookquote">``is that this sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore
was talking about. You-Know-Whos only been back two months and weve already started
fighting among ourselves. And the Sorting Hats warning was the same: stand together, be united
--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And Harry got it right last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>retorted Ron. <div class="bookquote">``If that means were supposed to get matey with the Slytherins-fat chance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think its a pity were not trying for a bit of inter-house unity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione crossly.
They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing
the Entrance Hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though
frightened he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might attack stragglers.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry
sarcastically.
They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, all looking instinctively at the staff table as
they entered. Professor Grubbly-Plank was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher,
and Hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) absence. The enchanted ceiling above them
echoed Harrys mood; it was a miserable rain-cloud grey.
<div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore didnt even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank womans staying,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor table.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe...''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione thoughtfully.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said both Harry and Ron together.
<div class="bookquote">``Well... maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) didnt want to draw attention to Hagrid not being here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean, draw attention to it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, half-laughing. <div class="bookquote">``How could we not notice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long braided hair had marched up to Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi, Angelina.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said briskly, <div class="bookquote">``good summer?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And without waiting for an answer, <div class="bookquote">``Listen, Ive been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nice one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, grinning at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) suspected Angelinas pep talks might not be as longwinded as Oliver Woods had been, which could only be an improvement.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Olivers left. Tryouts are on Friday at five oclock and I
want the whole team there, all right? Then we can see how the new personnel fit in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
Angelina smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and departed.
<div class="bookquote">``Id forgotten Wood had left,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione vaguely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sat down beside Ron and pulled a
plate of toast towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose that will make quite a difference to the team?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I spose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, taking the bench opposite. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) was a good Keeper...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Still, it wont hurt to have some new blood, will it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows. They
descended all over the Hall, bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the
breakfasters with droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard outside. Hedwig was nowhere to
be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) only correspondent was Sirius, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doubted
Sirius would have anything new to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) after only twenty-four hours apart. Hermione,
however, had to move her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) orange juice aside quickly to make way for a large damp barn owl
bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you still getting that for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry irritably, thinking of Seamus as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owls leg and it took off again. <div class="bookquote">``Im not bothering... load of rubbish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its best to know what the enemy is saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione darkly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) unfurled the
newspaper and disappeared behind it, not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) plate. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing
about you or Dumbledore or anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out schedules.
<div class="bookquote">``Look at today!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>groaned Ron. <div class="bookquote">``History of Magic, double Potions, Divination and double Defense Against the Dark Arts... Binns, Snape, Trelawney and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred and Georged hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do mine ears deceive me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, arriving with George and squeezing on to the bench beside Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Hogwarts prefects surely dont wish to skive off lessons?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look what weve got today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron grumpily, shoving his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) timetable under Freds nose.
<div class="bookquote">``Thats the worst Monday Ive ever seen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fair point, little bro,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, scanning the column. <div class="bookquote">``You can have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat
cheap if you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whys it cheap?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron suspiciously.
<div class="bookquote">``Because youll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we havent got an antidote yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George,
helping himself to a kipper.
<div class="bookquote">``Cheers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron moodily, pocketing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) timetable, <div class="bookquote">``but I think Ill take the lessons.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, eyeing Fred and George beadily,
<div class="bookquote">``you cant advertise for testers on the Gryffindor noticeboard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Says who?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, looking astonished.
<div class="bookquote">``Says me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``And Ron.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Leave me out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron hastily.
Hermione glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). Fred and George sniggered.
<div class="bookquote">``Youll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, thickly buttering a
crumpet. <div class="bookquote">``Youre starting your fifth year, youll be begging us for a Snackbox before long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>asked Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Fifth years OWL year,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.
<div class="bookquote">``So?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So youve got your exams coming up, havent you? Theyll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone theyll be rubbed raw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred with satisfaction.
<div class="bookquote">``Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to OWLs,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George happily. <div class="bookquote">``Tears and
tantrums... Patricia Stimpson kept coming over faint...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Kenneth Towler came out in boils, dyou remember?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred reminiscently.
<div class="bookquote">``Thats cause you put Bulbadox powder in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) pajamas,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, grinning. <div class="bookquote">``Id forgotten... hard to keep track sometimes, isnt it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anyway, its a nightmare of a year, the fifth,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``If you care about exam results,
anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our spirits up somehow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah... you got, what was it, three OWLs each?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Yep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred unconcernedly. <div class="bookquote">``But we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic
achievement.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said
George brightly, <div class="bookquote">``now that weve got-''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had been about to mention the
Triwizard winnings he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had given them.
<div class="bookquote">''- now that weve got our OWLs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>George said hastily. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, do we really need NEWTs? But
we didnt think Mum could take us leaving school early, not on top of Percy turning out to be the
worlds biggest prat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Were not going to waste our last year here, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, looking affectionately around at
the Great Hall. <div class="bookquote">``Were going to use it to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the
average Hogwarts student requires from a joke shop, carefully evaluate the results of our
research, then produce products to fit the demand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked skeptically.
<div class="bookquote">``Youre going to need all the ingredients and materials - and premises too, I suppose...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry did not look at the twins. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face felt hot; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) deliberately dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fork and dived
down to retrieve it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Fred say overhead, <div class="bookquote">``Ask us no questions and well tell you no lies,
Hermione. Cmon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears
before Herbology.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away, each carrying a stack
of toast.
<div class="bookquote">``What did that mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron. <div class="bookquote">''Ask us no questions...  Does that mean theyve already got some gold to start a joke shop?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know, Ive been wondering about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) brow furrowed. <div class="bookquote">``They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer and I couldnt understand where they got the Galleons...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters.
<div class="bookquote">``Dyou reckon its true this years going to be really tough? Because of the exams?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Bound to be, isnt it? OWLs are really important, affect the jobs you can
apply for and everything. We get career advice, too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can
choose what NEWTs you want to do next year.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dyou know what you want to do after Hogwarts?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked the other two, as they left the
Great Hall shortly afterwards and set off towards their History of Magic classroom.
<div class="bookquote">``Not really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Except... well...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked slightly sheepish.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Well, itd be cool to be an Auror,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron in an off-hand voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, it would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry fervently.
<div class="bookquote">``But theyre, like, the elite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Youve got to be really good. What about you, Hermione?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I think Id like to do something really worthwhile.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``An Aurors worthwhile!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is, but its not the only worthwhile thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``I mean, if I could take SPEW further...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other.
History of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever devised by wizardkind.
Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had a wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to
cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather. He (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) never varied the form of
their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while they took notes, or rather, gazed sleepily
into space. Harry and Ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying
Hermiones notes before exams; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binnss
voice.
Today, they suffered an hour and a halfs droning on the subject of giant wars. Harry heard just
enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teachers hands this
subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain disengaged, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spent the
remaining hour and twenty minutes playing hangman on a corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parchment with Ron,
while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eye.
<div class="bookquote">``How would it be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) asked them coldly, as they left the classroom for break -LRB-Binns drifting
away through the blackboard-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``if I refused to lend you my notes this year?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Binns</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wed fail our OWL,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``If you want that on your conscience, Hermione...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, youd deserve it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) snapped. <div class="bookquote">``You dont even try to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), do you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We do try''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``We just havent got your brains or your memory or your concentration -
youre just cleverer than we are - is it nice to rub it in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dont give me that rubbish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked slightly mollified as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) led the
way out into the damp courtyard.
A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in huddles around the edges of the
yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a
heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air
and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year. They had got
as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult, just to catch them off
guard after a two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner towards them.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, Harry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cho/Cho Chang/Chang</b></font>)</div>It was Cho Chang and, what was more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) own again. This was most unusual: Cho
was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of
trying to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) by herself to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) to the Yule Ball.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face grow hot. At least youre not covered in Stinksap this time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines.
<div class="bookquote">``You got that stuff off, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as
opposed to mortifying. <div class="bookquote">``So, did you... er... have a good summer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had said this he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadnt - Cedric had been Chos boyfriend and the
memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) death must have affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harrys.
Something seemed to tauten in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, it was all right, you know...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that a Tornados badge?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Ron demanded suddenly, pointing to the front of Chos robes, where a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double gold T was pinned. <div class="bookquote">``You dont support them, do you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cho/Cho Chang/Chang</b></font>)</div>said Cho.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, in
what Harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Ive supported them since I was six,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cho/Cho Chang/Chang</b></font>)</div>said Cho coolly. <div class="bookquote">``Anyway... see you, Harry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding
on Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``You are so tactless!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What? I only asked her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) if -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Couldnt you tell she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wanted to talk to Harry on her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So? She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) couldve done, I wasnt stopping -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why on earth were you attacking her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Quidditch team?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Attacking? I wasnt attacking her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), I was only -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who cares if she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) supports the Tornados?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But what does it matter!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It means theyre not real fans, theyre just jumping on the bandwagon -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats the bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry dully, because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear
it. They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snapes dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of
time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) would be lucky ever to have two minutes of
conversation with Cho that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) could look back on without wanting to leave the country.
And yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside Snapes classroom door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had
chosen to come and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), hadnt she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had been Cedrics girlfriend; she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) could easily
have hated Harry for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) was
talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) mad, or a liar, or in
some horrible way responsible for Cedrics death... yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) had definitely chosen to come and
talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>), and that made the second time in two days... and at this thought, Harrys spirits rose.
Even the ominous sound of Snapes dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small,
hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) filed into the classroom behind Ron
and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sat down between
Ron and Hermione and ignored the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them.
<div class="bookquote">``Settle down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>).
There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class had heard the door close, quiet
had fallen and all fidgeting stopped. Snapes mere presence was usually enough to ensure a
classs silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Before we begin todays lesson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, sweeping over to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) desk and staring around at
them all, <div class="bookquote">``I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important
examination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition
and use of magical potions. Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are, I expect you to
scrape an Acceptable in your OWL, or suffer my... displeasure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) gaze lingered this time on Neville, who gulped.
<div class="bookquote">``After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape went on. <div class="bookquote">``I take only the very best into my NEWT Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying goodbye.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes rested on Harry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) lip curled. Harry glared back, feeling a grim pleasure at the idea
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be able to give up Potions after fifth year.
<div class="bookquote">``But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape softly, ``so,
whether or not you are intending to attempt NEWT, I advise all of you to concentrate your
efforts upon maintaining the high pass level I have come to expect from my OWL students.
``Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the
Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation. Be warned: if you are too
heavy-handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes
irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing.'' On Harrys left,
Hermione sat up a little straighter, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) expression one of utmost attention. ``The ingredients and
method -<div class="bookquote">'' Snape flicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>- are on the blackboard -<div class="bookquote">'' -LRB-they appeared there-RRB- '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>- you will find everything you need --<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) flicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand again '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>- in the store cupboard --<div class="bookquote">'' -LRB-the door of the said cupboard sprang open-RRB- '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>- you have an hour and a half... start.''
Just as Harry, Ron and Hermione had predicted, Snape could hardly have set them a more
difficult, fiddly potion. The ingredients had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right
order and quantities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times, firstly in
clockwise, then in anti-clockwise directions; the heat of the flames on which it was simmering
had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final
ingredient was added.
``A light silver vapour should now be rising from your potion,'' called Snape, with ten minutes left to go.
Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the dungeon. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own cauldron
was issuing copious amounts of dark grey steam; Rons was spitting green sparks. Seamus was
feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) cauldron with the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) wand, as they
seemed to be going out. The surface of Hermiones potion, however, was a shimmering mist of
silver vapour, and as Snape swept by he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) looked down his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hooked nose at it without comment,
which meant he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) could find nothing to criticize.
At Harrys cauldron, however, Snape stopped, and looked down at it with a horrible smirk on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
face.
``Potter, what is this supposed to be?''
The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they loved hearing Snape taunt
Harry.
``The Draught of Peace,'' said Harry tensely.
``Tell me, Potter,'' said Snape softly, ``can you read?''
Draco Malfoy laughed.
``Yes, I can,'' said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers clenched tightly around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand.
``Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.<div class="bookquote">''
Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of
multi-colored steam now filling the dungeon.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counter-clockwise, allow to simmer for seven
minutes then add two drops of syrup of hellebore.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart sank. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not added syrup of hellebore, but had proceeded straight to the fourth line
of the instructions after allowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) potion to simmer for seven minutes.
``Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?''
``No,'' said Harry very quietly.
``I beg your pardon?''
``No,'' said Harry, more loudly. ``I forgot the hellebore.''
``I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly worthless. Evanesco.''
The contents of Harrys potion vanished; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was left standing foolishly beside an empty
cauldron.
``Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your
potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing,'' said Snape.
``Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion making, to be handed in on Thursday.''
While everyone around him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) filled their flagons, Harry cleared away his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) things, seething. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
potion had been no worse than Rons, which was now giving off a foul odour of bad eggs; or
Nevilles, which had achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was now
having to gouge out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) cauldron; yet it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>), Harry, who would be receiving zero marks for
the days work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stuffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag and slumped down on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seat, watching
everyone else march up to Snapes desk with filled and corked flagons. When at long last the bell
rang, Harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lunch by the time Ron and
Hermione joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) in the Great Hall. The ceiling had turned an even murkier grey during the
morning. Rain was lashing the high windows.
``That was really unfair,'' said Hermione consolingly, sitting down next to Harry and helping
herself to shepherds pie. ``Your potion wasnt nearly as bad as Goyles; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)
flagon the whole thing shattered and set his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) robes on fire.''
``Yeah, well,'' said Harry, glowering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) plate, ``since when has Snape ever been fair to me?''
Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape and Harrys mutual enmity had
been absolute from the moment Harry had set foot in Hogwarts.
``I did think he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) might be a bit better this year,'' said Hermione in a disappointed voice. ``I mean...
you know...<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked around carefully; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of
them and nobody was passing the table '' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>... now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s in the Order and everything.''
``Poisonous toadstools dont change their spots,'' said Ron sagely. ``Anyway Ive always thought
Dumbledore was cracked trusting Snape. Wheres the evidence he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) ever really stopped working for You-Know-Who?''
``I think Dumbledores probably got plenty of evidence, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) doesnt share it with you, Ron,'' snapped Hermione.
``Oh, shut up, the pair of you,'' said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth to argue back.
Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. ``Cant you give it a rest?'' said Harry. ``Youre always having a go at each other, its driving me mad.'' And abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shepherds pie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) schoolbag back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder and left them sitting there.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many students hurrying towards
lunch. The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and the vision of
Ron and Hermiones shocked faces afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) a sense of deep satisfaction. Serve them right,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) thought, why cant they give it a rest... bickering all the time... its enough to drive anyone upthe wall...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing; Sir Cadogan drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sword
and brandished it fiercely at Harry, who ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Come back, you scurvy dog! Stand fast and fight!'' yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) visor, but Harry merely walked on and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) by
running into a neighboring picture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and angry-looking
wolfhound.
Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of North
Tower. Consequently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sibyll Trelawneys
classroom when the bell rang.
After Potions, Divination was Harrys least favorite class, which was due mainly to Professor
Trelawneys habit of predicting his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) premature death every few lessons. A thin woman, heavily
draped in shawls and glittering with strings of beads, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always reminded Harry of some kind of
insect, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glasses hugely magnifying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was busy putting copies of battered
leather-bound books on each of the spindly little tables with which her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room was littered when
Harry entered the room, but the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the low-burning,
sickly-scented fire was so dim she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appeared not to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a seat in the shadows.
The rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes. Ron emerged from the trapdoor, looked
around carefully, spotted Harry and made directly for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), or as directly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could while
having to wend his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way between tables, chairs and overstuffed pouffes.
``Hermione and me have stopped arguing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, sitting down beside Harry.
``Good,'' grunted Harry.
``But Hermione says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us,'' said Ron.
``Im not -''
``Im just passing on the message,'' said Ron, talking over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``But I reckon she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)s right. Its not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat you.''
``I never said it -''
``Good-day,'' said Professor Trelawney in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usual misty, dreamy voice, and Harry broke off,
again feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself. ``And welcome back to Divination. I
have, of course, been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays, and am delighted
to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safely - as, of course, I knew you would.
<div class="bookquote">``You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle, by Inigo Imago. Dream
interpretation is a most important means of divining the future and one that may very probably
be tested in your OWL. Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are of the
remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination. If you have the Seeing Eye,
certificates and grades matter very little. However, the Headmaster likes you to sit the
examination, so...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that Professor Trelawney
considered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) subject above such sordid matters as examinations.
<div class="bookquote">``Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say on the matter of dream
interpretation. Then, divide into pairs. Use The Dream Oracle to interpret each others most recent dreams. Carry on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a double period. By the time
they had all finished reading the introduction of the book, they had barely ten minutes left for
dream interpretation. At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with Neville, who
immediately embarked on a long-winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant
scissors wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) grandmothers best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly.
<div class="bookquote">``I never remember my dreams,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, <div class="bookquote">``you say one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You must remember one of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry impatiently.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not going to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dreams with anyone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew perfectly well what his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) regular
nightmare about a graveyard meant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not need Ron or Professor Trelawney or the
stupid Dream Oracle to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I dreamed I was playing Quidditch the other night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, screwing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face in an
effort to remember. <div class="bookquote">``What dyou reckon that means?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Probably that youre going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry,
turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without interest. It was very dull work looking up bits of
dreams in the Oracle and Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task
of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell went, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) and Ron led the way
back down the ladder, Ron grumbling loudly.
<div class="bookquote">``Dyou realize how much homework weve got already? Binns set us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones, and now weve got a months dream diary from Trelawney! Fred and George werent wrong about OWL year, were they? That
Umbridge woman had better not give us any...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>When they entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom they found Professor Umbridge
already seated at the teachers desk, wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the
black velvet bow on top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched
unwisely on top of an even larger toad.
The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge was, as yet, an unknown quantity
and nobody knew how strict a disciplinarian she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was likely to be.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, good afternoon!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, when finally the whole class had sat down.
A few people mumbled <div class="bookquote">``good afternoon''  (<font color='red'><b>A people</b></font>)</div>in reply.
<div class="bookquote">``Tut, tut,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge. <div class="bookquote">``That wont do, now, will it? I should like you, please, to reply Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge. One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>they chanted back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``There, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge sweetly. <div class="bookquote">``That wasnt too difficult, was it? Wands away
and quills out, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order <div class="bookquote">``wands away''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting. Harry shoved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand back inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag and pulled out quill, ink and parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) handbag, extracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:
Defense Against the Dark Arts A Return to Basic Principles
<div class="bookquote">``Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasnt it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hands clasped neatly in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
``The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would
expect to see in your OWL year.
``You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be
following a carefully structured, theory-centerd, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic
this year. Copy down the following, please.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and was replaced by: Course
Aims:
1. Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic.
2. Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic can legally be used.
3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use.
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When
everyone had copied down Professor Umbridges three course aims she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) asked, ``Has everybody
got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?''
There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.
``I think well try that again,'' said Professor Umbridge. ``When I ask you a question, I should like
you to reply, Yes, Professor Umbridge, or No, Professor Umbridge. So: has everyone got a
copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?''
``Yes, Professor Umbridge,'' rang through the room.
``Good,'' said Professor Umbridge. ``I should like you to turn to page five and read Chapter One,
Basics for Beginners. There will be no need to talk.''
Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teachers desk,
observing them all closely with those pouchy toads eyes. Harry turned to page five of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) copy
of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read.
It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) concentration
sliding away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more
than the first few words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), Ron was absent-mindedly
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) quill over and over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fingers, staring at the same spot on the page. Harry looked
right and received a surprise to shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) torpor. Hermione had not even opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
copy of Defensive Magical Theory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hand
in the air.
Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed
resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) nose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
enquiringly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) merely shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head slightly to indicate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was not about to answer
questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as resolutely in
another direction.
After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only one watching
Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more
people were choosing to watch Hermiones mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridges eye
rather than struggle on with Basics for Beginners.
When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at their books, Professor
Umbridge seemed to decide that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) could ignore the situation no longer.
``Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) asked Hermione, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had only just noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
``Not about the chapter, no,'' said Hermione.
``Well, were reading just now,'' said Professor Umbridge, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) small pointed teeth. ``If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.''
``Ive got a query about your course aims,'' said Hermione.
Professor Umbridge raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) eyebrows.
``And your name is?''
``Hermione Granger,'' said Hermione.
``Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through
carefully'' said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.
``Well, I dont,'' said Hermione bluntly. ``Theres nothing written up there about using defensive
spells.''
There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the
three course aims still written on the blackboard.
``Using defensive spells?'' Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh. ``Why, I cant imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely arent expecting to be attacked during class?''
``Were not going to use magic?'' Ron exclaimed loudly.
``Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. -?''
``Weasley,'' said Ron, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hand into the air.
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) back on him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>). Harry and Hermione
immediately raised their hands too. Professor Umbridges pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a
moment before she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) addressed Hermione.
``Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?''
``Yes,'' said Hermione. ``Surely the whole point of Defence Against the Dark Arts is to practice
defensive spells?''
``Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?'' asked Professor Umbridge, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) falsely sweet voice.
``No, but -''
``Well then, Im afraid you are not qualified to decide what the whole point of any class is.
Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new program of study. You will
be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way -''
``What use is that?'' said Harry loudly. ``If were going to be attacked, it wont be in a -''
``Hand, Mr. Potter!'' sang Professor Umbridge.
Harry thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fist in the air. Again, Professor Umbridge promptly turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), but
now several other people had their hands up, too.
``And your name is?'' Professor Umbridge said to Dean.
``Dean Thomas.''
``Well, Mr. Thomas?''
``Well, its like Harry said, isnt it?'' said Dean. ``If were going to be attacked, it wont be risk free.''
``I repeat,'' said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, ``do you expect to be attacked during my classes?''
``No, but -''
Professor Umbridge talked over him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>). ``I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in
this school,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, an unconvincing smile stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wide mouth, ``but you have been
exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed - not to
mention,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) gave a nasty little laugh, ``extremely dangerous half-breeds.''
``If you mean Professor Lupin,'' piped up Dean angrily, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was the best we ever -''
``Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying - you have been introduced to spells that have been
complex, inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into
believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day -''
``No we havent,'' Hermione said, ``we just -''
``Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!''
Hermione put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand. Professor Umbridge turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
``It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
actually performed them on you.''
``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) turned out to be a maniac, didnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)?'' said Dean hotly. ``Mind you, we still learned
loads.''
``Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas!'' trilled Professor Umbridge. ``Now, it is the view of the
Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your
examination, which, after all, is what school is all about. And your name is?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) added, staring
at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up.
``Parvati Patil, and isnt there a practical bit in our Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL? Arent
we supposed to show that we can actually do the counter-curses and things?''
``As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be
able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,'' said Professor
Umbridge dismissively.
``Without ever practicing them beforehand?'' said Parvati incredulously. ``Are you telling us that the first time well get to do the spells will be during our exam?''
``I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough -''
``And what goods theory going to be in the real world?'' said Harry loudly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) fist in the air again.
Professor Umbridge looked up.
``This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said softly.
``So were not supposed to be prepared for whats waiting for us out there?''
``There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.''
``Oh, yeah?'' said Harry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) temper, which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point.
``Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?'' enquired Professor Umbridge in
a horribly honeyed voice.
``Hmm, lets think...'' said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice. ``Maybe... Lord Voldemort!''
Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville slipped sideways off his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) stool.
Professor Umbridge, however, did not flinch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied
expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) face.
``Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.''
The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry.
``Now, let me make a few things quite plain.''
Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned towards them, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) stubby-fingered hands splayed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
desk.
``You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead -''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) wasnt dead,'' said Harry angrily, ``but yeah, he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>)s returned!''
``Mr-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-house-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for yourself,'' said Professor Umbridge in one breath without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.''
``It is NOT a lie!'' said Harry. ``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>), I fought him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>)!''
``Detention, Mr. Potter!'' said Professor Umbridge triumphantly. ``Tomorrow evening. Five
oclock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in
danger from any Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside
class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear
about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading.
Page five, Basics for Beginners.''
Professor Umbridge sat down behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) desk. Harry, however, stood up. Everyone was staring
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); Seamus looked half-scared, half-fascinated.
``Harry, no!'' Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) sleeve, but Harry jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
arm out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) reach.
``So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) own accord, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>)?'' Harry asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice shaking.
There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from Ron and
Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk about what had happened on the night Cedric had died.
They stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) eyes and was staring
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) without a trace of a fake smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) face.
``Cedric Diggorys death was a tragic accident,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said coldly.
``It was murder,'' said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could feel himself shaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had hardly spoken to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates. ``Voldemort killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) and you know it.''
Professor Umbridges face was quite blank. For a moment, Harry thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was going to
scream at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) softest, most sweetly girlish voice, ``Come here, Mr. Potter,
dear.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the teachers desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
could feel the rest of the class holding its breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) felt so angry he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) did not care what happened
next.
Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) handbag, stretched it out on
the desk, dipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry
could not see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) rolled up the
parchment and tapped it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not open it.
``Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,'' said Professor Umbridge, holding out the note to him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) without saying a word, turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) heel and left the room, not even looking
back at Ron and Hermione, slamming the classroom door shut behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) walked very fast
along the corridor, the note to McGonagall clutched tight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hand, and turning a corner
walked slap into Peeves the poltergeist, a wide-mouthed little man floating on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back in midair,
juggling several inkwells.
``Why its Potty Wee Potter!'' cackled Peeves, allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground
where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink; Harry jumped backwards out of the way
with a snarl.
``Get out of it, Peeves.''
``Oooh, Crackpots feeling cranky'' said Peeves, pursuing Harry along the corridor, leering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
zoomed along above him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``What is it this time, my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing
visions? Speaking in -<div class="bookquote">'' Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-- tongues?''
``I said, leave me ALONE!'' Harry shouted, running down the nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves
merely slid down the banister on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Oh, most think he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)s barking, the potty wee lad, But some are more kindly and think he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)s just sad, but Peevesy knows better and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)s mad -- ''
``SHUT UP!''
A door to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged from her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) office looking grim
and slightly harassed.
``What on earth are you shouting about, Potter?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) snapped, as Peeves cackled gleefully and
zoomed out of sight. ``Why arent you in class?''
``Ive been sent to see you,'' said Harry stiffly.
``Sent? What do you mean, sent?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) held out the note from Professor Umbridge. Professor McGonagall took it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>),
frowning, slit it open with a tap of her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) wand, stretched it out and began to read. Her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) eyes zoomed
from side to side behind their square spectacles as she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) read what Umbridge had written, and with
each line they became narrower.
``Come in here, Potter.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) study. The door closed automatically behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).
``Well?'' said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>). ``Is this true?''
``Is what true?'' Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had intended. ``Professor?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added, in an attempt to sound more polite.
``Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?''
``Yes,'' said Harry.
``You called her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) a liar?''
``Yes.''
``You told her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?''
``Yes.''
Professor McGonagall sat down behind her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) desk, watching Harry closely. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said, ``Have a biscuit, Potter.''
``Have - what?''
``Have a biscuit,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin of cookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) desk. ``And sit down.''
There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be caned by Professor
McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) to the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sank into a
chair opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) and helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong footed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newt</b></font>) had done on that occasion.
Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridges note and looked very seriously at Harry.
``Potter, you need to be careful.''
Harry swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginger</b></font>) tone of voice was not at all
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was used to; it was not brisk, crisp and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much
more human than usual.
``Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridges class could cost you much more than house points and a
detention.''
``What do you -?''
``Potter, use your common sense,'' snapped Professor McGonagall, with an abrupt return to her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
usual manner. ``You know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) comes from, you must know to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) is reporting.''
The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of
hundreds of students on the move.
``It says here she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow,'' Professor
McGonagall said, looking down at Umbridges note again.
``Every evening this week!'' Harry repeated, horrified. ``But, Professor, couldnt you -?''
``No, I couldnt,'' said Professor McGonagall flatly.
``But -''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You will go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) room at five
oclock tomorrow for the first one. Just remember: tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.''
``But I was telling the truth!'' said Harry, outraged. ``Voldemort is back, you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) is; Professor Dumbledore knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) is -''
``For heavens sake, Potter!'' said Professor McGonagall, straightening her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) glasses angrily -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) had winced horribly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had used Voldemorts name-RRB-. ``Do you really think this is about truth or lies? Its about keeping your head down and your temper under control!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and Harry stood up, too.
``Have another biscuit,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said irritably, thrusting the tin at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``No, thanks,'' said Harry coldly.
``Dont be ridiculous,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) snapped.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took one.
``Thanks,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said grudgingly.
``Didnt you listen to Dolores Umbridges speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter?''
``Yeah,'' said Harry. ``Yeah... she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said... progress will be prohibited or... well, it meant that... that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts.''
Professor McGonagall eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closely for a moment, then sniffed, walked around her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) desk and
held open the door for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Well, Im glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said, pointing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
office.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Detention with Dolores
Dinner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry. The news about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
shouting match with Umbridge had traveled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts standards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)
heard whispers all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) sat eating between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was
that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) overhearing what they were saying about him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>).
On the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) would get angry and start shouting again,
so that they could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) story first-hand.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) saw Cedric Diggory murdered...''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) reckons he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) dueled with You-Know-Who...''
``Come off it...''
``Who does he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) think he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>)s kidding?''
``Pur-Lease...''
``What I dont get,'' said Harry through clenched teeth, laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knife and fork -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands
were shaking too much to hold them steady-RRB-, ``is why they all believed the story two months ago
when Dumbledore told them...''
``The thing is, Harry, Im not sure they did,'' said Hermione grimly. ``Oh, lets get out of here.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) slammed down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) own knife and fork; Ron looked longingly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) half-finished apple pie
but followed suit. People stared at them all the way out of the Hall.
``What dyou mean, youre not sure they believed Dumbledore?'' Harry asked Hermione when
they reached the first-floor landing.
``Look, you dont understand what it was like after it happened,'' said Hermione quietly. ``You
arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedrics dead body... none of us saw what
happened in the maze... we just had Dumbledores word for it that You-Know-Who had come
back and killed Cedric and fought you.''
``Which is the truth!'' said Harry loudly.
``I know it is, Harry, so will you please stop biting my head off?'' said Hermione wearily. ``Its just that before the truth could sink in, everyone went home for the summer, where they spent two months reading about how youre a nutcase and Dumbledores going senile!''
Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to Gryffindor
Tower. Harry felt as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first day had lasted a week, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) still had a mountain of
homework to do before bed. A dull pounding pain was developing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right eye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced
out of a rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned into the Fat Ladys corridor.
There was still no light in Hagrids cabin.
``Mimbulus mimbletonia,'' said Hermione, before the Fat Lady could ask. The portrait swung
open to reveal the hole behind it and the three of them scrambled through it.
The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still down at dinner. Crookshanks
uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry,
Ron and Hermione took their three favorite chairs at the fireside he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leapt lightly on to
Hermiones lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion. Harry gazed into the flames,
feeling drained and exhausted.
``How can Dumbledore have let this happen?'' Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron
jump; Crookshanks leapt off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), looking affronted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pounded the arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) chair in fury, so
that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes. ``How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) let that terrible woman teach us? And in
our OWL year, too!''
``Well, weve never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, have we?'' said Harry.
``You know what its like, Hagrid told us, nobody wants the job; they say its jinxed.''
``Yes, but to employ someone whos actually refusing to let us do magic! Whats Dumbledore
playing at?''
``And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)s trying to get people to spy for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),'' said Ron darkly. ``Remember when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted us to come and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if we hear anyone saying You-Know-Whos back?''
``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)s here to spy on us all, thats obvious, why else would Fudge have wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to
come?'' snapped Hermione.
``Dont start arguing again,'' said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth to retaliate. ``Cant we
just... lets just do that homework, get it out of the way...''
They collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs by the fire. People were
coming back from dinner now. Harry kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face averted from the portrait hole, but could still
sense the stares he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was attracting.
``Shall we do Snapes stuff first?'' said Ron, dipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) quill into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ink. ``The properties... of
moonstone... and its uses... in potion-making...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) muttered, writing the words across the top
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) parchment as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) spoke them. ``There.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) underlined the title, then looked up expectantly
at Hermione.
``So, what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making?''
But Hermione was not listening; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was squinting over into the far corner of the room, where
Fred, George and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the center of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag
that Fred was holding.
``No, Im sorry, theyve gone too far,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, standing up and looking positively furious.
``Come on, Ron.''
``I - what?'' said Ron, plainly playing for time. ``No- come on, Hermione - we cant tell them off
for giving out sweets.''
``You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or - or Puking Pastilles or -''
``Fainting Fancies?'' Harry suggested quietly.
One by one, as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet, the first-years were slumping
unconscious in their seats; some slid right on to the floor, others merely hung over the arms of
their chairs, their tongues lolling out. Most of the people watching were laughing; Hermione,
however, squared her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood
with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first-years. Ron rose halfway out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chair,
hovered uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to Harry, ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)s got it under control,''
before sinking as low in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lanky frame permitted.
``Thats enough!'' Hermione said forcefully to Fred and George, both of whom looked up in mild
surprise.
``Yeah, youre right,'' said George, nodding, ``this dosage looks strong enough, doesnt it?''
``I told you this morning, you cant test your rubbish on students!''
``Were paying them!'' said Fred indignantly.
``I dont care, it could be dangerous!''
``Rubbish,'' said Fred.
``Calm down, Hermione, theyre fine!'' said Lee reassuringly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) walked from first-year to first year, inserting purple sweets into their open mouths.
``Yeah, look, theyre coming round now,'' said George.
A few of the first-years were indeed stirring. Several looked so shocked to find themselves lying
on the floor, or dangling off their chairs, that Harry was sure Fred and George had not warned
them what the sweets were going to do.
``Feel all right?'' said George kindly to a small dark-haired girl lying at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) feet.
``I - I think so,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said shakily.
``Excellent,'' said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had snatched both his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hands.
``It is NOT excellent!''
``Course it is, theyre alive, arent they?'' said Fred angrily.
``You cant do this, what if you made one of them really ill?''
``Were not going to make them ill, weve already tested them all on ourselves, this is just to see
if everyone reacts the same -''
``If you dont stop doing it, Im going to -''
``Put us in detention?'' said Fred, in an Id-like-to-see-you-try-it voice.
``Make us write lines?'' said George, smirking.
Onlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione drew herself up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) full height; her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes were narrowed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity.
``No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) voice quivering with anger, ``but I will write to your mother.''
``You wouldnt,'' said George, horrified, taking a step back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
``Oh, yes, I would,'' said Hermione grimly. ``I cant stop you eating the stupid things yourselves,
but youre not to give them to the first-years.''
Fred and George looked thunderstruck. It was clear that as far as they were concerned,
Hermiones threat was way below the belt. With a last threatening look at them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) thrust Freds
clipboard and the bag of Fancies back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) arms, and stalked back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) chair by the fire. Ron was now so low in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) seat that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) nose was roughly level with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) knees.
``Thank you for your support, Ron,'' Hermione said acidly.
``You handled it fine by yourself,'' Ron mumbled.
Hermione stared down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) blank piece of parchment for a few seconds, then said edgily, ``Oh,
its no good, I cant concentrate now. Im going to bed.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wrenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag open; Harry thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was about to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) books away, but instead she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
pulled out two misshapen woolly objects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace,
covered them with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill and stood back to
admire the effect.
``What in the name of Merlin are you doing?'' said Ron, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) as though fearful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
sanity.
``Theyre hats for house-elves,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said briskly, now stuffing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) books back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag. ``I did
them over the summer. Im a really slow knitter without magic but now Im back at school I
should be able to make lots more.''
``Youre leaving out hats for the house-elves?'' said Ron slowly. ``And youre covering them up
with rubbish first?''
``Yes,'' said Hermione defiantly, swinging her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) back.
``Thats not on,'' said Ron angrily. ``Youre trying to trick them into picking up the hats. Youre
setting them free when they might not want to be free.''
``Of course they want to be free!'' said Hermione at once, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face was turning pink.
``Dont you dare touch those hats, Ron!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) heel and left. Ron waited until she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had disappeared through the door to the
girls dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats.
``They should at least see what theyre picking up,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said firmly. ``Anyway...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) rolled up the
parchment on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had written the title of Snapes essay, ``theres no point trying to finish
this now, I cant do it without Hermione, I havent got a clue what youre supposed to do with
moonstones, have you?''
Harry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, noticing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did so that the ache in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right temple was getting worse.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sharply. Knowing
perfectly well that when the morning came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would regret not finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) homework that
night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) piled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) books back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag.
``Im going to bed too.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories, but did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Harry had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) mouth to speak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) sped up and
reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more
provocation.
The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one. Hagrid was still absent
from the staff table at breakfast.
``But on the plus side, no Snape today'' said Ron bracingly.
Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked mildly pleased about
something, and when Ron asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had to be so happy about, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) simply said, ``The
hats have gone. Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all.''
``I wouldnt bet on it,'' Ron told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cuttingly. ``They might not count as clothes. They didnt look anything like hats to me, more like woolly bladders.''
Hermione did not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) all morning.
Double Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration. Professor Flitwick and Professor
McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the
importance of OWLs.
``What you must remember,'' said little Professor Flitwick squeakily perched as ever on a pile of
books so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) could see over the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) desk, ``is that these examinations may influence
your futures for many years to come! If you have not already given serious thought to your
careers, now is the time to do so. And in the meantime, Im afraid, we shall be working harder
than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!''
They then spent over an hour reviewing Summoning Charms, which according to Professor
Flitwick were bound to come up in their OWL, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) rounded off the lesson by setting them
their largest ever amount of Charms homework.
It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.
``You cannot pass an OWL,'' said Professor McGonagall grimly, ``without serious application,
practice and study. I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an OWL in
Transfiguration as long as they put in the work.'' Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise.
``Yes, you too, Longbottom,'' said Professor McGonagall. ``Theres nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So... today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until NEWT level, but they are still
among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your OWL.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By the end of a double
period neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practicing,
though Ron said hopefully he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the other hand,
successfully vanished her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) snail on the third attempt, earning her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor
from Professor McGonagall. She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) was the only person not given homework; everybody else was
told to practice the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following
afternoon.
Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do, Harry and Ron spent
their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion-making. Still angry
about Rons slur on her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) woolly hats, Hermione did not join them. By the time they reached Care
of Magical Creatures in the afternoon, Harrys head was aching again.
The day had become cool and breezy, and as they walked down the sloping lawn towards
Hagrids cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, they felt the occasional drop of rain on their
faces. Professor Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Hagrids front
door, a long trestle table in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) laden with twigs. As Harry and Ron reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), a loud
shout of laughter sounded behind them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding towards them,
surrounded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) usual gang of Slytherin cronies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had clearly just said something highly
amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson and the rest continued to snigger heartily as
they gathered around the trestle table and, judging by the way they all kept looking over at
Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty.
``Everyone here?'' barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the Slytherins and Gryffindors had
arrived. ``Lets crack on then. Who can tell me what these things are called?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) indicated the heap of twigs in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). Hermiones hand shot into the air. Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
back, Malfoy did a buck-toothed imitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a
question. Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream, as
the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of wood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand and a funny flat, barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes glittered.
``Oooooh!'' said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry. Anyone would have thought
Hagrid had never shown them impressive creatures; admittedly, the Flobberworms had been a bit
dull, but the Salamanders and Hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast-Ended
Skrewts perhaps too much so.
``Kindly keep your voices down, girls!'' said Professor Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a
handful of what looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the
food. ``So - anyone know the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?''
``Bowtruckles,'' said Hermione. ``Theyre tree-guardians, usually live in wand-trees.''
``Five points for Gryffindor,'' said Professor Grubbly-Plank. ``Yes, these are Bowtruckles, and as
Miss Granger rightly says, they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody
know what they eat?''
``Woodlice,'' said Hermione promptly which explained why what Harry had taken to be grains of
brown rice were moving. ``But fairy eggs if they can get them.''
``Good girl, take another five points. So, whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which
a Bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of woodlice ready to distract or placate it. They may
not look dangerous, but if angered they will try to gouge at human eyes with their fingers, which,
as you can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs. So if youd like to gather
closer, take a few woodlice and a Bowtruckle - I have enough here for one between three - you
can study them more closely. I want a sketch from each of you with all body-parts labeled by
the end of the lesson.''
The class surged forwards around the trestle table. Harry deliberately circled around the back so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-Plank.
``Wheres Hagrid?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), while everyone else was choosing Bowtruckles.
``Never you mind,'' said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, which had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) attitude last
time Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class, too. Smirking all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) pointed face, Draco
Malfoy leaned across Harry and seized the largest Bowtruckle.
``Maybe,'' said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), ``the stupid great oafs
got himself badly injured.''
``Maybe you will if you dont shut up,'' said Harry out of the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth.
``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)s been messing with stuff thats too big for him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), if you get my drift.''
Malfoy walked away, smirking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) shoulder at Harry, who felt suddenly sick. Did Malfoy
know something? His (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) father was a Death Eater after all; what if he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had information about
Hagrids fate that had not yet reached the ears of the Order? He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) hurried back around the table to
Ron and Hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to
persuade a Bowtruckle to remain still long enough for them to draw it. Harry pulled out
parchment and quill, crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what Malfoy had
just said.
``Dumbledore would know if some thing had happened to Hagrid,'' said Hermione at once. ``Its
just playing into Malfoys hands to look worried; it tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) we dont know exactly whats
going on. Weve got to ignore him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), Harry. Here, hold the Bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can
draw its face...''
``Yes,'' came Malfoys clear drawl from the group nearest them, ``Father was talking to the
Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministrys really
determined to crack down on sub-standard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown
moron does show up again, he (<font color='blue'><b>moron</b></font>)ll probably be sent packing straightaway.''
``OUCH!''
Harry had gripped the Bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped, and it had just taken a
great retaliatory swipe at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand with its sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there. Harry
dropped it. Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being
sacked, laughed still harder as the Bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the Forest, a little
moving stick-man soon swallowed up among the tree roots. When the bell echoed distantly over
the grounds, Harry rolled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) blood-stained Bowtruckle picture and marched off to Herbology
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand wrapped in Hermiones handkerchief, and Malfoys derisive laughter still ringing
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) ears.
``If he (<font color='blue'><b>moron</b></font>) calls Hagrid a moron one more time...'' said Harry through gritted teeth.
``Harry, dont go picking a row with Malfoy, dont forget, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s a prefect now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could make life
difficult for you...''
``Wow, I wonder what itd be like to have a difficult life?'' said Harry sarcastically. Ron laughed,
but Hermione frowned. Together, they traipsed across the vegetable patch. The sky still appeared
unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not.
``I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, thats all,'' said Harry in a low voice, as they
reached the greenhouses. ``And dont say that Grubbly-Plank womans a better teacher!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added threateningly.
``I wasnt going to,'' said Hermione calmly.
``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)ll never be as good as Hagrid,'' said Harry firmly, fully aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just
experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about
it.
The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth-years spilled out of it, including
Ginny.
``Hi,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) said brightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) passed. A few seconds later, Luna Lovegood emerged, trailing
behind the rest of the class, a smudge of earth on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) nose, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) hair tied in a knot on the top
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) head. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) saw Harry, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) made a
beeline straight for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) classmates turned curiously to watch. Luna took a great
breath and then said, without so much as a preliminary hello, ``I believe He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back and I believe you fought him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and escaped from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''
``Er - right,'' said Harry awkwardly. Luna was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes
for earrings, a fact that Parvati and Lavender seemed to have noticed, as they were both giggling
and pointing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) earlobes.
``You can laugh,'' Luna said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) voice rising, apparently under the impression that Parvati and
Lavender were laughing at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) had said rather than what she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) was wearing, ``but people used
to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned
Snorkack!''
``Well, they were right, werent they? said Hermione impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``There werent any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>Luna gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) a withering look and flounced away, radishes swinging madly Parvati and
Lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now.
<div class="bookquote">``Dyou mind not offending the only people who believe me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked Hermione as they
made their way into class.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, for heavens sake, Harry, you can do better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Ginnys told me all
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>); apparently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)ll only believe in things as long as theres no proof at all. Well, I
wouldnt expect anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry thought of the sinister winged horses he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen on the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had arrived and how
Luna had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could see them too. His (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) spirits sank slightly. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) been lying? But before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) could devote much more thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Macmillan</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I want you to know, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Macmillan</b></font>) said in a loud, carrying voice, <div class="bookquote">``that its not only weirdos who
support you. I personally believe you one hundred percent. My family have always stood firm
behind Dumbledore, and so do I.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Er - thanks very much, Ernie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, taken aback but pleased. Ernie might be pompous on
occasions like this, but Harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from
somebody who did not have radishes dangling from their ears. Ernies words had certainly wiped
the smile from Lavender Browns face and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernie</b></font>) turned to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry
caught Seamuss expression, which looked both confused and defiant.
To nobodys surprise, Professor Sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the
importance of OWLs. Harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was starting to get
an anxious, twisted feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered how much homework he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave them yet another
essay at the end of class. Tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprouts
preferred type of fertilizer, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later,
none of them talking very much; it had been another long day.
As Harry was starving, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first detention with Umbridge at five oclock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) headed
straight for dinner without dropping off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag in Gryffindor Tower so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could bolt
something down before facing whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had barely reached the
entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Oy, Potter!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Great</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
was in a towering temper.
<div class="bookquote">``Ill tell you what now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, marching straight up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) and poking him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) hard in the chest
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) finger. <div class="bookquote">``How come youve landed yourself in detention for five oclock on Friday?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Why... oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>) remembers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>snarled Angelina. <div class="bookquote">``Didnt I tell you I wanted to do a tryout with the wholeteam, and find someone who fitted in with everyone! Didnt I tell you Id booked the Quidditch pitch specially? And now youve decided youre not going to be there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didnt decide not to be there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, stun g by the injustice of these words. <div class="bookquote">``I got
detention from that Umbridge woman, just because I told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the truth about You-Know-Who.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can just go straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to let you off on Friday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina fiercely, <div class="bookquote">``and I dont care how you do it. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) You-Know-Whos a figment of your imagination if you like, just make sure youre there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) heel and stormed away.
<div class="bookquote">``You know what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they entered the Great Hall. <div class="bookquote">``I think wed better check with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Woods been killed during a training
session, because Angelina seems to be channeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) spirit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron skeptically,
as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.
<div class="bookquote">``Less than zero,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry glumly, tipping lamb c hops on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) plate and starting to eat. <div class="bookquote">``Better try, though, hadnt I? Ill offer to do two more detentions or something, I dunno...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
swallowed a mouthful of potato and added, <div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) doesnt keep me too long this evening.
You realize weve got to write three essays, practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, work out
a counter-charm for Flitwick, finish the Bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for
Trelawney?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling.
<div class="bookquote">``And it looks like its going to rain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whats that got to do with our homework?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyebrows raised.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron at once, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ears reddening.
At five to five Harry bade the other two goodbye and set off for Umbridges office on the third
floor. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knocked on the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) called, <div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in a sugary voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) entered
cautiously, looking around.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had known this office under three of its previous occupants.
In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of
himself. When Lupin had occupied it, it was likely you would meet some fascinating Dark
creature in a cage or tank if you came to call. In the impostor Moodys days it had been packed
with various instruments and artifacts for the detection of wrong doing and concealment.
Now, however, it looked totally unrecognizable. The surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers
and cloths. There were several vases full of dried flowers, each one residing on its own doily,
and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large
technicolor kitten wearing a different bow around its neck. These were so foul that Harry stared
at them, transfixed, until Professor Umbridge spoke again.
<div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Mr. Potter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry started and looked around. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) at first because she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was wearing a
luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Evening, Professor Umbridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said stiffly.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, pointing towards a small table draped in lace beside which she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had
drawn up a straight-backed chair. A piece of blank parchment lay on the table, apparently
waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Er,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, without moving. <div class="bookquote">``Professor Umbridge. Er - before we start, I - I wanted to ask
you a... a favor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) bulging eyes narrowed.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Im... Im in the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for
the new Keeper at five oclock on Friday and I was - was wondering whether I could skip
detention that night and do it - do it another night... instead...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sentence that it was no good.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had just swallowed a
particularly juicy fly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, no, no. This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty,
attention-seeking stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the
guilty ones convenience. No, you will come here at five oclock tomorrow, and the next day,
and on Friday too, and you will do your detentions as planned. I think it rather a good thing that
you are missing something you really want to do. It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to
teach you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry felt the blood surge to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head and heard a thumping noise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told evil,
nasty, attention-seeking stones, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) head slightly to one side, still smiling widely, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
knew exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was thinking and was waiting to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would start shouting
again. With a massive effort, Harry looked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) schoolbag beside the
straight-backed chair and sat down.
<div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge sweetly, <div class="bookquote">``were getting better at controlling our temper already, arent
we? Now, you are going to be doing some lines for me, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
added, as Harry bent down to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag. <div class="bookquote">``Youre going to be using a rather special one of
mine. Here you are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp point.
<div class="bookquote">``I want you to write, I must not tell lies,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) softly.
<div class="bookquote">``How many times?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of politeness.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge sweetly. <div class="bookquote">``Off you go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) moved over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) desk, sat down and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays
for marking. Harry raised the sharp black quill, then realized what was missing.
<div class="bookquote">``You havent given me any ink,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, you wont need ink,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
voice.
Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote: I must not tell lies.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) let out a gasp of pain. The words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be
shining red ink. At the same time, the words had appeared on the back of Harrys right hand, cut
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skin as though traced there by a scalpel - yet even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stared at the shining cut, the skin
healed over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite
smooth.
Harry looked round at Umbridge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a
smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quietly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked back at the parchment, placed the quill on it once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and
felt the searing pain on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand for a second time; once again, the words had been
cut into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skin; once again, they healed over seconds later.
And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) soon came
to realize was not ink, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own blood. And, again and again, the words were cut into the back
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand, healed, and reappeared the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) set quill to parchment.
Darkness fell outside Umbridges window. Harry did not ask when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be allowed to stop.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not even check his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for signs of weakness and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was not going to show any, not even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to sit there all night, cutting open his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own hand
with this quill...
<div class="bookquote">``Come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, after what seemed hours.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood up. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand was stinging painfully. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked down at it he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw that the cut had
healed, but that the skin there was red raw.
<div class="bookquote">``Hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) extended it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) took it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) own. Harry repressed a shudder as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
thick, stubby fingers on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wore a number of ugly old rings.
<div class="bookquote">``Tut, tut, I dont seem to have made much of an impression yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Well, well
just have to try again tomorrow evening, wont we? You may go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry left her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) office without a word. The school was quite deserted; it was surely past midnight.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked slowly up the corridor, then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had turned the corner and was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) would
not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), broke into a run.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not had time to practice Vanishing Spells, had not written a single dream in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dream
diary and had not finished the drawing of the Bowtruckle, nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) written his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) essays. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination,
their first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled Ron keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) company.
<div class="bookquote">``How come you didnt do it last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, as Ron stared wildly around the common
room for inspiration. Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory,
muttered something about <div class="bookquote">``doing other stuff'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>, bent low over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parchment and scrawled a few
words.
<div class="bookquote">``Thatll have to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, slamming the diary shut. <div class="bookquote">``Ive said I dreamed I was buying a new
pair of shoes, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cant make anything weird out of that, can she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They hurried off to North Tower together.
<div class="bookquote">``How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) make you do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, <div class="bookquote">``Lines.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats not too bad, then, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Nope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey - I forgot - did she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) let you off for Friday?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
Ron groaned sympathetically.
It was another bad day for Harry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having
practiced Vanishing Spells at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lunch hour to complete the picture of the
Bowtruckle and, meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank and Sinistra gave them yet
more homework, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) second
detention with Umbridge. To cap it all, Angelina Johnson tracked him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) down at dinner again and,
on learning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) would not be able to attend Fridays Keeper tryouts, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was not at
all impressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>) attitude and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) expected players who wished to remain on the team to
put training before their other commitments.
<div class="bookquote">``Im in detention!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled after her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) s talked away. <div class="bookquote">``Dyou think Id rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At least its only lines,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bench and
looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) steak and kidney pie, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) no longer fancied very much. <div class="bookquote">``Its not as if
its a dreadful punishment, really...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth, closed it again and nodded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not really sure why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not
telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridges room: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) only knew that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and
therefore more difficult to face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge,
a private battle of wills, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was not going to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) the satisfaction of hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had
complained about it.
<div class="bookquote">``I cant believe how much homework weve got,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron miserably.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, why didnt you do any last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Where were you, anyway?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was... I fancied a walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron shiftily.
Harry had the distinct impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not alone in concealing things at the moment.
The second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on the back of Harrys hand
became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed. Harry thought it unlikely that
it would keep healing as effectively for long. Soon the cut would remain etched into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand and
Umbridge would, perhaps, be satisfied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) let no gasp of pain escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), however, and from
the moment of entering the room to the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dismissal, again past midnight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said
nothing but <div class="bookquote">``good evening''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``goodnight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) returned to the Gryffindor
common room he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not, though exhausted, go to bed, but opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) books and began Snapes
moonstone essay. It was half past two by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had finished it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done a poor
job, but there was no help for it; unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had something to give in he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be in detention
with Snape next. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall had set
them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of Bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-
Plank, and staggered up to bed, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Plank</b></font>) fell fully clothed on top of the covers and fell asleep
immediately.
Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness. Ron seemed very sleepy too, though Harry could not see
why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should be. Harrys third detention passed in the same way as the previous two, except
that after two hours the words I must not tell lies did not fade from the back of Harrys hand, but
remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood. The pause in the pointed quills scratching
made Professor Umbridge look up.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said softly, moving around her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) desk to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) hand herself. <div class="bookquote">``Good. That ought to
serve as a reminder to you, oughtnt it? You may leave for tonight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do I still have to come back tomorrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry picking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) schoolbag with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left hand
rather than his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) smarting right one.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, smiling as widely as before. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think we can etch the
message a little deeper with another evenings work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the
world he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hated more than Snape, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) walked back towards Gryffindor Tower he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had to
admit he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had found a strong contender. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s evil, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) climbed a staircase to the
seventh floor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s an evil, twisted, mad old-
<div class="bookquote">``Ron?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had reached the top of the stairs, turned right and almost walked into Ron, who was lurking
behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Lachlan</b></font>) broomstick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lachlan</b></font>) gave a great leap of surprise
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lachlan</b></font>) saw Harry and attempted to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new Cleansweep Eleven behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Er - nothing. What are you doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry frowned at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im - Im hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``They just went past with a bunch of first-years, I bet theyre testing stuff on them again. I mean, they cant do it in the
common room now, can they, not with Hermione there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was talking in a very fast, feverish way.
<div class="bookquote">``But what have you got your broom for, you havent been flying, have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I - well - well, okay, Ill tell you, but dont laugh, all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron said defensively, turning redder with every second. <div class="bookquote">``I - I thought Id try out for Gryffindor Keeper now Ive got a decent broom. There. Go on. Laugh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im not laughing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. Ron blinked. <div class="bookquote">``Its a brilliant idea! Itd be really cool if you got on the team! Ive never seen you play Keeper, are you good?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im not bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harrys reaction. <div class="bookquote">``Charlie, Fred and
George always made me Keep for them when they were training during the holidays.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So youve been practicing tonight?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Every evening since Tuesday... just on my own, though. Ive been trying to bewitch Quaffles to
fly at me, but it hasnt been easy and I dont know how much use itll be.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron looked nervous
and anxious. <div class="bookquote">``Fred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when I turn up for the
tryouts. They havent stopped taking the mickey out of me since I got made a prefect.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish I was going to be there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry bitterly, as they set off together towards the common
room.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, so do - Harry, whats that on the back of your hand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry, who had just scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) free right hand, tried to hide it, but had as much
success as Ron with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) Cleansweep.
<div class="bookquote">``Its just a cut - its nothing - its -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>But Ron had grabbed Harrys forearm and pulled the back of Harrys hand up level with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
eyes. There was a pause, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stared at the words carved into the skin, then, looking
sick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) released Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought you said she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was just giving you lines?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), so he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) told Ron the truth about the
hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had been spending in Umbridges office.
<div class="bookquote">``The old hag!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) head against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) frame. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)s sick! Go to McGonagall, say
something!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry at once. <div class="bookquote">``Im not giving her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) the satisfaction of knowing she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)s got to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Got to you? You cant let her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) get away with this!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont know how much power McGonagalls got over her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry flatly.
<div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s got enough on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, but that was not the true reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not going to
go to Dumbledore for help when Dumbledore had not spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) once since June.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I reckon you should -''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron began, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was interrupted by the Fat Lady, who had been
watching them sleepily and now burst out, <div class="bookquote">``Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Fat Lady</b></font>)</div>Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though Harry automatically glanced
towards the staff table when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) entered the Great Hall, it was without any real hope of seeing
Hagrid, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind immediately to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) more pressing problems, such as the
mountainous pile of homework he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with
Umbridge.
Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the
other was that, dreadful though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) final detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a distant
view of the Quidditch pitch from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) window and might, with luck, be able to see something of
Rons tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for
anything that might lighten his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) present darkness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never had a worse first week of term at
Hogwarts.
At five oclock that evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knocked on Professor Umbridges office door for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
sincerely hoped would be the final time, and was told to enter. The blank parchment lay ready
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it.
<div class="bookquote">``You know what to do, Mr. Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, smiling sweetly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) just shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair an inch or
so to the right... on the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) managed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) now had
a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a
dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to
Keep. It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance.
I must not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right hand opened and began to bleed
afresh.
I must not tell lies. The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting.
I must not tell lies. Blood trickled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrist.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was defending the goalposts now was
doing a very poor job indeed. Katie Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared to watch.
Hoping very much that the Keeper wasnt Ron, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes back to the parchment
shining with blood.
I must not tell lies.
I must not tell lies.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked up whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could risk it; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could hear the scratching of
Umbridges quill or the opening of a desk drawer. The third person to try out was pretty good, the
fourth was terrible, the fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save.
The sky was darkening, and Harry doubted he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be able to see the sixth and seventh people
at all.
I must not tell lies.
I must not tell lies.
The parchment was now dotted with drops of blood from the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand, which was
searing with pain. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) next looked up, night had fallen and the Quidditch pitch was no
longer visible.
<div class="bookquote">``Lets see if youve gotten the message yet, shall we?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Umbridges soft voice half an hour later. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moved towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) short ringed fingers for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm. And then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to examine the words now cut into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skin, pain seared, not across the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand, but across the scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead. At the same time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) midriff.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grip and leapt to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
a smile stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wide, slack mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, it hurts, doesnt it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said softly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not answer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart was thumping very hard and fast. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) talking about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand or
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead?
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I think Ive made my point, Mr. Potter. You may go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) caught up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could.
Stay calm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sprinted up the stairs. Stay calm, it doesnt necessarily mean
what you think it means...
<div class="bookquote">``Mimbulus mimbletonia!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung forwards once more.
A roar of sound greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Ron came running towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), beaming all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face and
slopping Butterbeer down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) front from the goblet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was clutching.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, I did it, Im in, Im Keeper!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What? Oh - brilliant!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, trying to smile naturally, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart continued to race and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand throbbed and bled.
<div class="bookquote">``Have a Butterbeer.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron pressed a bottle on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I cant believe it - wheres Hermione gone?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)s there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, who was also swigging Butterbeer, and pointed to an armchair by the
fire. Hermione was dozing in it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) drink tipping precariously in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was pleased when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking slightly put out.
<div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George hastily. It was a few moments before Harry noticed that several of
the first-years gathered around them bore unmistakable signs of recent nosebleeds.
<div class="bookquote">``Come here, Ron, and see if Olivers old robes fit you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katie/Katie Bell/Bell</b></font>)</div>called Katie Bell, <div class="bookquote">``we can take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)
name and put yours on instead...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katie/Katie Bell/Bell</b></font>)</div>As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) said abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``Its stressful this managing
lark, you know, Im starting to think I was a bit hard on Wood sometimes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) was watching
Ron over the rim of her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) goblet with a slight frown on her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)s your best mate, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)s not fabulous,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) said bluntly. <div class="bookquote">``I think with a bit of
training he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)ll be all right, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) comes from a family of good Quidditch players. Im
banking on him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) turning out to have a bit more talent than he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) showed today, to be honest. Vicky
Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hoopers a real whiner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hooper</b></font>)s
always moaning about something or other, and Vickys involved in all sorts of societies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vicky</b></font>)
admitted herself that if training clashed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vicky</b></font>) Charms Club she (<font color='blue'><b>Vicky</b></font>)d put Charms first. Anyway,
were having a practice session at two oclock tomorrow, so just make sure youre there this
time. And do me a favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) nodded, and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry moved over to sit next to
Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Harry, its you... good about Ron, isnt it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said blearily. <div class="bookquote">``Im just so-so - so tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
yawned. <div class="bookquote">``I was up until one oclock making more hat s. Theyre disappearing like mad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And sure enough, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked, Harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all
around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up.
<div class="bookquote">``Great,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry distractedly; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not tell somebody soon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would burst. <div class="bookquote">``Listen,
Hermione, I was just up in Umbridges office and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) touched my arm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said slowly <div class="bookquote">``Youre worried You-
Know-Whos controlling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) like he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) controlled Quirrell?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``its a possibility, isnt it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sounded unconvinced. <div class="bookquote">``But I dont think he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) can
be possessing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) possessed Quirrell, I mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)s properly alive again now, isnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)s got his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) own body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) wouldnt need to share someone elses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) could have her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) under the
Imperius Curse, I suppose...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry watched Fred, George and Lee Jordan juggling empty Butterbeer bottles for a moment.
Then Hermione said, <div class="bookquote">``But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didnt
Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe
this hasnt got anything to do with Umbridge at all, maybe its just coincidence it happened
while you were with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s evil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry flatly. <div class="bookquote">``Twisted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s horrible, yes, but... Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was the second time in two days he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been advised to go to Dumbledore and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) answer to
Hermione was just the same as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) answer to Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Im not bothering him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with this. Like you just said, its not a big deal. Its been hurting on and
off all summer - it was just a bit worse tonight, thats all -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry, Im sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could stop himself, <div class="bookquote">``thats the only bit of me Dumbledore cares
about, isnt it, my scar?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont say that, its not true!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think Ill write and tell Sirius about it, see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) thinks -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry, you cant put something like that in a letter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking alarmed. <div class="bookquote">``Dont
you remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing! We just cant guarantee owls
arent being intercepted any more!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right, all right, I wont tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>), then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry irritably. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Im going to
bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking relieved, <div class="bookquote">``if youre going that means I can go too, without being rude. Im absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if you like, its quite fun, Im getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Harry looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
vaguely tempted by this offer.
<div class="bookquote">``Er... no, I dont think I will, thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Er- not tomorrow. Ive got loads of homework to
do...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) traipsed off to the boys stairs, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looking slightly disappointed.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Percy and Padfoot
Harry was first to wake up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dormitory next morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lay for a moment watching dust
swirl in the chink of sunlight coming through the gap in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) four-posters hangings, and savored
the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed to have dragged on forever, like
one gigantic History of Magic lesson.
Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight, it was just
after daybreak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled open the curtains around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed, got up and started to dress. The only
sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fellow
Gryffindors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) schoolbag carefully, pulled out parchment and quill and headed out
of the dormitory for the common room.
Making straight for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) favorite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, Harry settled
himself down comfortably and unrolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parchment while looking around the room. The
detritus of crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars and sweet
wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone, as were all
Hermiones elf hats. Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they
wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ink bottle, dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quill into it, then held it suspended
an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parchment, thinking hard... but after a minute
or so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to write him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) letters over
the summer. How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past
week and pose all the questions he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot
of information he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) did not want them to have?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment.
Dear Snuffles,
Hope youre okay, the first week back heres been terrible, Im really glad its the weekend.
Weve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s nearly as
nice as your mum. Im writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened
again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge.
Were all missing our biggest friend, we hope he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)ll be back soon.
Please write back quickly.
Best,
Harry
Harry reread the letter several times, trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could not see how they would know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was talking about - or who he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was talking to - just
from reading this letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might be back. Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to
what Hagrid might be up to while he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not at Hogwarts.
Considering it was a very short letter, it had taken a long time to write; sunlight had crept
halfway across the room while he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been working on it and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could now hear distant sounds
of movement from the dormitories above. Sealing the parchment carefully, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) climbed through
the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery.
<div class="bookquote">``I would not go that way if I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/NICK</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick, drifting disconcertingly
through a wall just ahead of Harry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked down the passage. <div class="bookquote">``Peeves is planning an
amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the persons head?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>asked Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Funnily enough, it does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/NICK</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored voice. <div class="bookquote">``Subtlety has never been
Peevess strong point. Im off to try and find the Bloody Baron... he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) might be able to put a stop
to it... see you, Harry''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry and instead of turning right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spirits rose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had training later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last.
Something brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ankles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked down and saw the caretakers skeletal grey cat, Mrs.
Norris, slinking past him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) turned lamplike yellow eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for a moment before
disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful.
<div class="bookquote">``Im not doing anything wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry called after her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had the unmistakable air of a cat
that was off to report to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) boss, yet Harry could not see why; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was perfectly entitled to walk
up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning.
The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows
dazzled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which
hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early-morning light, some clearly just
returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stepped across tiny animal
bones, craning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck for a sight of Hedwig.
<div class="bookquote">``There you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, spotting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling. <div class="bookquote">``Get
down here, Ive got a letter for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With a low hoot she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) stretched her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) great white wings and soared down on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder.
<div class="bookquote">``Right, I know this says Snuffles on the outside,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>), giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) the letter to clasp in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)
beak and, without knowing exactly why, whispering, <div class="bookquote">``but its for Sirius, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) blinked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) amber eyes once and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took that to mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) understood.
<div class="bookquote">``Safe flight, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) to one of the windows; with a moments
pressure on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm, Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) until she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)
became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gaze to Hagrids hut, clearly visible
from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn.
The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry watched them, savoring
the fresh air on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, thinking about Quidditch later... then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw it. A great, reptilian
winged horse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery black wings spread
wide like a pterodactyls, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great
circle, then plunged back into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly, Harry could
hardly believe what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen, except that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart was hammering madly.
The Owlery door opened behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leapt in shock and, turning quickly, saw Cho Chang
holding a letter and a parcel in her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry automatically.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh... hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said breathlessly. <div class="bookquote">``I didnt think anyone would be up here this early... I only
remembered five minutes ago, its my mums birthday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) held up the parcel.
<div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain seemed to have jammed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to say something funny and
interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind.
<div class="bookquote">``Nice day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, gesturing to the windows. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment.
The weather. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was talking about the weather...
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. <div class="bookquote">``Good Quidditch conditions. I havent been
out all week, have you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) coaxed it down on to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) arm where it held
out an obliging leg so that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) could attach the parcel.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Its my friend Ron Weasley, dyou know him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Tornados-hater?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cho/Cho Chang/Chang</b></font>)</div>said Cho rather coolly. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) any good?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``I think so. I didnt see his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) tryout, though, I was in detention.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owls legs.
<div class="bookquote">``That Umbridge womans foul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``Putting you in detention just because
you told the truth about how - how - how he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) died. Everyone heard about it, it was all over the
school. You were really brave standing up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harrys insides re-inflated so rapidly he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might actually float a few inches off
the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared about a stupid flying horse; Cho thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) had been
really brave. For a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) cut hand as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) helped her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) tie her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) parcel on to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) owl... but the very instant this thrilling thought occurred,
the Owlery door opened again.
Filch the caretaker came wheezing into the room. There were purple patches on his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) sunken,
veined cheeks, his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) jowls were aquiver and his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) thin grey hair disheveled; he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) had obviously run
here. Mrs. Norris came trotting at his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily.
There was a restless shifting of wings from above and a large brown owl snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) beak in a
menacing fashion.
``Aha! said Filch, taking a flat-footed step toward s Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pouchy cheeks trembling with
anger. ``Ive had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!''
Harry folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms and stared at the caretaker.
``Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?''
Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) arm, tired of standing
on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) ignored it.
``I have my sources,'' said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss. ``Now hand over whatever it is youre
sending.''
Feeling immensely thankful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) had not dawdled in posting off the letter, Harry said, ``I cant,
its gone.''
``Gone?'' said Filch, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face contorting with rage.
``Gone,'' said Harry calmly.
Filch opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked Harrys robes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
eyes.
``How do I know you havent got it in your pocket?''
``Because -''
``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) send it,'' said Cho angrily.
Filch rounded on her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>).
``You saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) -?''
``Thats right, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) said fiercely.
There was a moments pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho glared right back, then the
caretaker turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) heel and shuffled back towards the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) stopped with his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) hand on the
handle and looked back at Harry.
``If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stumped off down the stairs. Mrs. Norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Harry and Cho looked at each other.
``Thanks,'' Harry said.
``No problem,'' said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owls other leg, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) face slightly
pink. ``You werent ordering Dungbombs, were you?''
``No,'' said Harry.
``I wonder why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought you were, then?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) carried the owl to the window.
Harry shrugged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was quite as mystified by that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was, though oddly it was not bothering
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very much at the moment.
They left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the
castle, Cho said, ``Im going this way. Well, Ill... Ill see you around, Harry.''
``Yeah... see you.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) and departed. Harry walked on, feeling quietly elated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had managed to
have an entire conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) and not embarrassed himself once... you were really brave
standing up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) like that... Cho had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) brave... she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) did not hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) for being alive...
Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had preferred Cedric, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) knew that... though if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>)d only asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) to the Ball
before Cedric had, things might have turned out differently... she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had seemed sincerely sorry
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)d had to refuse when Harry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)...
``Morning,'' Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) joined them at the Gryffindor table in
the Great Hall.
``What are you looking so pleased about?'' said Ron, eyeing Harry in surprise.
``Erm... Quidditch later,'' said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Oh... yeah...'' said Ron. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) put down the piece of toast he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was eating and took a large swig of
pumpkin juice. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, ``Listen... you dont fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you?
Just to - er - give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit.''
``Yeah, okay,'' said Harry.
``Look, I dont think you should,'' said Hermione seriously. ``Youre both really behind on
homework as it -''
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the Daily Prophet was soaring
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) in the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and
held out a leg. Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper, and scanned
the front page critically as the owl took off.
``Anything interesting?'' said Ron. Harry grinned, knowing Ron was keen to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) off the
subject of homework.
``No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sighed, ``just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married.''
Hermione opened the paper and disappeared behind it. Harry devoted himself to another helping
of eggs and bacon. Ron was staring up at the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied.
``Wait a moment,'' said Hermione suddenly. ``Oh no... Sirius!''
``Whats happened?<div class="bookquote">'' said Harry, snatching at the paper so violently it ripped down the middle,
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Hermione each holding one half.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Ministry of Magic/Ministry/Magic Office Ministry of Magic Harry</b></font>)</div>The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source that Sirius Black, notorious
mass murderer... blah blah blah... is currently hiding in London!'' Hermione read from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) half
in an anguished whisper.
``Lucius Malfoy Ill bet anything,'' said Harry in a low, furious voice. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) did recognize Sirius on the platform...''
``What?'' said Ron, looking alarmed. ``You didnt say -''
``Shh!<div class="bookquote">'' said the other two.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>... warns wizarding community that Black is very dangerous... killed thirteen people... broke
out of Azkaban...  the usual rubbish,'' Hermione concluded, laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) half of the paper
and looking fearfully at Harry and Ron. ``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) just wont be able to leave the house again,
thats all,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) whispered. ``Dumbledore did warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) not to.''
Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had torn off. Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madam Malkins Robes for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale.
``Hey!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could see it. ``Look at this!''
``Ive got all the robes I want,'' said Ron.
``No,'' said Harry. ``Look... this little piece here...''
Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the
bottom of a column. It was headlined:
TRESPASS AT MINISTRY
Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum Garden s, Clapham, has appeared in front of the
Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on31st
August. Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watchwizard Eric Munch, who found him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>)
attempting to force his (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) way through a top-security door at one oclock in the morning. Podmore,
who refused to speak in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) own defense, was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six
months in Azkaban.
``Sturgis Podmore?'' said Ron slowly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s that bloke who looks like his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) heads been thatched,
isnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s one of the Ord--''
``Ron, shh!'' said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them.
``Six months in Azkaban!'' whispered Harry, shocked. ``Just for trying to get through a door!''
``Dont be silly, it wasnt just for trying to get through a door. What on earth was he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) doing at the
Ministry of Magic at one oclock in the morning?'' breathed Hermione.
``Dyou reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) was doing something for the Order?'' Ron muttered.
``Wait a moment...'' said Harry slowly. ``Sturgis was supposed to come and see us off,
remember?''
The other two looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Yeah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) was supposed to be part of our guard going to Kings Cross, remember? And Moody
was all annoyed because he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) didnt turn up; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) couldnt have been on a job for them, could
he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>)?''
``Well, maybe they didnt expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) to get caught,'' said Hermione.
``It could be a frame-up!'' Ron exclaimed excitedly. ``No - listen!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) went on, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) voice
dramatically at the threatening look on Hermiones face. ``The Ministry suspects he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>)s one of
Dumbledores lot so - I dunno - they lured him (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) to the Ministry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) wasnt trying to get
through a door at all! Maybe theyve just made something up to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>)!''
There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this. Harry thought it seemed farfetched.
Hermione, on the other hand, looked rather impressed.
``Do you know, I wouldnt be at all surprised if that were true.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) folded up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) half of the newspaper thoughtfully. As Harry laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knife and fork, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
seemed to come out of a reverie.
``Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on self-fertilizing shrubs first and if
were lucky well be able to start McGonagalls Inanimatus Conjurus Spell before lunch...''
Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) upstairs,
but the sky was a clear, exhilarating blue, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not been on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Firebolt for a week...
``I mean, we can do it tonight,'' said Ron, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and Harry walked down the sloping lawns towards the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, and with Hermiones dire warnings that they would fail all their OWLs still ringing in their ears. ``And weve got tomorrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) gets too worked up about work, thats her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) trouble...'' There was a pause and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added, in a slightly more anxious tone, ``Dyou think she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) meant it when she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said we werent copying from her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)?''
``Yeah, I do,'' said Harry. ``Still, this is important, too, weve got to practice if we want to stay on
the Quidditch team...''
``Yeah, thats right,'' said Ron, in a heartened tone. ``And we have got plenty of time to do it all...''
As they approached the Quidditch pitch, Harry glanced over to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right to where the trees of the
Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a
few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery tower. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had enough to worry about; the flying
horse wasnt doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) any harm; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pushed it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind.
They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, Ron guarding the
three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought
Ron was pretty good; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and
played better the longer they practiced. After a couple of hours they returned to the castle for
lunch - during which Hermione made it quite clear she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) thought they were irresponsible -- then
returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session. All their teammates but Angelina
were already in the changing room when they entered.
``All right, Ron?'' said George, winking at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
``Yeah,'' said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch.
``Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?'' said Fred, emerging tousle-haired from the neck of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
Quidditch robes, a slightly malicious grin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) face.
``Shut up,'' said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own team robes for the first time. They fitted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) well considering they had been Oliver Woods, who was rather broader in the shoulder.
``Okay, everyone,'' said Angelina, entering from the Captains office, already changed. ``Lets get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring out the ball crate for us. Oh, and there are a couple of
people out there watching but I want you to just ignore them, all right?''
Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) would-be casual voice made Harry think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might know who the uninvited
spectators were, and sure enough, when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the
pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted
hangers-on, who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly
around the stadium.
``Whats that Weasleys riding?'' Malfoy called in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) sneering drawl. ``Why would anyone put a
flying charm on a mouldy old log like that?''
Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter. Ron mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears turn red from
behind.
``Ignore them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, accelerating to catch up with Ron, ``well see whos laughing after we
play them...''
``Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,'' said Angelina approvingly, soaring around them with the
Quaffle under her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) airborne team. ``Okay,
everyone, were going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team please -''
``Hey, Johnson, whats with that hairstyle, anyway?'' shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. ``Why would anyone want to look like theyve got worms coming out of their head?''
Angelina swept her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) long braided hair out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) face and continued calmly, ``Spread out, then,
and lets see what we can do...''
Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch. Ron fell back towards the
opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed
to George, who passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it.
The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter. Ron, who had pelted towards
the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) slipped
sideways on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) broom, and returned to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred and George
exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was grateful.
``Pass it on, Ron,'' called Angelina, as though nothing had happened.
Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who passed to George...
``Hey, Potter, hows your scar feeling?'' called Malfoy. ``Sure you dont need a lie down? It must
be, what, a whole week since you were in the hospital wing, thats a record for you, isnt it?''
George passed to Angelina; she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) reverse-passed to Harry, who had not been expecting it, but
caught it in the very tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers and passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed
by inches.
``Come on now, Ron,'' said Angelina crossly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) dived for the ground again, chasing the
Quaffle. ``Pay attention.''
It would have been hard to say whether Rons face or the Quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
again returned to playing height. Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with
laughter.
On his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) passed it on so
enthusiastically that it soared straight through Katies outstretched hands and hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) hard in the
face.
``Sorry!'' Ron groaned, zooming forwards to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had done any damage.
``Get back in position, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)s fine!'' barked Angelina. ``But as youre passing to a teammate, do try
not to knock her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) off her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) broom, wont you? Weve got Bludgers for that!''
Katies nose was bleeding. Down below, the Slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering.
Fred and George converged on Katie.
``Here, take this,'' Fred told her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>), handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) something small and purple from out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pocket,
``itll clear it up in no time.''
``All right,'' called Angelina, ``Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger. Ron, get up to
the goalposts. Harry, release the Snitch when I say so. Were going to aim for Rons goal,
obviously.''
Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch.
``Rons making a right pigs ear of things, isnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)?'' muttered George, as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s just nervous,'' said Harry, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was fine when I was practicing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) this morning.''
``Yeah, well, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hasnt peaked too soon,'' said Fred gloomily.
They returned to the air. When Angelina blew her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) whistle, Harry released the Snitch and Fred
and George let fly the Bludger. From that moment on, Harry was barely aware of what the others
were doing. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred
and fifty points to the Seekers team and doing so required enormous speed and skill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seeker</b></font>)
accelerated, rolling and swerving in and out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air whipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Seeker</b></font>)
face, and the distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his (<font color='blue'><b>Seeker</b></font>) ears... but too
soon, the whistle brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Seeker</b></font>) to a halt again.
``Stop - stop - STOP!'' screamed Angelina. ``Ron - youre not covering your middle post!''
Harry looked round at Ron, who was hovering in front of the left-hand hoop, leaving the other
two completely unprotected.
``Oh... sorry...''
``You keep shifting around while youre watching the Chasers!'' said Angelina. ``Either stay in
center position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but dont drift
vaguely off to one side, thats how you let in the last three goals!''
``Sorry...'' Ron repeated, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky.
``And Katie, cant you do something about that nosebleed?''
``Its just getting worse!'' said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the flow with her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) sleeve.
Harry glanced round at Fred, who was looking anxious and checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Fred
pull out something purple, examine it for a second and then look round at Katie, evidently
horror-struck.
``Well, lets try again,'' said Angelina. She (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) was ignoring the Slytherins, who had now set up a
chant of ``Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor are losers,'' but there was a certain rigidity about her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>)
seat on the broom nevertheless.
This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when Angelinas whistle sounded. Harry,
who had just sighted the Snitch circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly
aggrieved.
``What now?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest.
``Katie,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) said shortly.
Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred and George all flying as fast as they could towards Katie.
Harry and Alicia sped towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>), too. It was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in
time; Katie was now chalk white and covered in blood.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) needs the hospital wing,'' said Angelina.
``Well take her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>),'' said Fred. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) - er - might have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake -''
``Well, theres no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone,'' said Angelina glumly as
Fred and George zoomed off towards the castle supporting Katie between them. ``Come on, lets
go and get changed.''
The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the changing rooms.
``How was practice?'' asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour later, as Harry and Ron climbed
through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room.
``It was -'' Harry began.
``Completely lousy,'' said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair beside Hermione. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
looked up at Ron and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) frostiness seemed to melt.
``Well, it was only your first one,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said consolingly, ``its bound to take time to -''
``Who said it was me who made it lousy?'' snapped Ron.
``No one,'' said Hermione, looking taken aback, ``I thought -''
``You thought I was bound to be rubbish?''
``No, of course I didnt! Look, you said it was lousy so I just -''
``Im going to get started on some homework,'' said Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase
to the boys dormitories and vanished from sight. Hermione turned to Harry.
``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) lousy?''
``No,'' said Harry loyally.
Hermione raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyebrows.
``Well, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) couldve played better,'' Harry muttered, ``but it was only the first training
session, like you said...''
Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night. Harry
knew Ron was too preoccupied with how badly he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had performed at Quidditch practice and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
himself was having difficulty in getting the ``Gryffindor are losers'' chant out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head.
They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in their books while the room
around them filled up, then emptied. It was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow
Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last
sunshine that year. By the evening, Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain
against the inside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skull.
``You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,'' Harry
muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagalls long essay on the Inanimatus
Conjurus Spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistras equally long and difficult essay
about Jupiters many moons.
``Yeah,'' said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. ``Listen... shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)s done?''
Harry glanced over at her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) was sitting with Crookshanks on her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) lap and chatting merrily to
Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>), now knitting a pair of
shapeless elf socks.
``No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said heavily, ``you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wont let us.''
And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker. Slowly, the
crowd in the common room began to thin again. At half past eleven, Hermione wandered over to
them, yawning.
``Nearly done?''
``No,'' said Ron shortly.
``Jupiters biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, pointing over Rons shoulder at a
line in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) Astronomy essay, ``and its lo thats got the volcanoes.''
``Thanks,'' snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences.
``Sorry, I only -''
``Yeah, well, if youve just come over here to criticize -''
``Ron -''
``I havent got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, Im up to my neck in it here -''
``No - look!''
Hermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron both looked over. A handsome
screech owl was standing on the windowsill, gazing into the room at Ron.
``Isnt that Hermes?'' said Hermione, sounding amazed.
``Blimey, it is!'' said Ron quietly, throwing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) quill and getting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet. ``Whats Percy
writing to me for?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, landed on Rons essay and held out
a leg to which a letter was attached. Ron took the letter off it and the owl departed at once,
leaving inky footprints across Rons drawing of the moon lo.
``Thats definitely Percys handwriting,'' said Ron, s inking back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chair and staring at the
words on the outside of the scroll: Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) looked up
at the other two. ``What dyou reckon?''
``Open it!'' said Hermione eagerly, and Harry nodded.
Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read. The further down the parchment his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes traveled, the
more pronounced became his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) scowl. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had finished reading, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked disgusted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
thrust the letter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned towards each other to read it together:
Dear Ron,
I have only just heard -LRB-from no less a person than the Minister for Magic himself, who has it
from your new teacher, Professor Umbridge-RRB- that you have become a Hogwarts prefect.
I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations.
I must admit that I have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the Fred and George route, rather than following in my footsteps, so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility.
But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, I want to give you some advice, which is
why I am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post. Hopefully, you will be able
to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions.
From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect, I gather that you are
still seeing a lot of Harry Potter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of
losing your badge more than continued fraternization with that boy. Yes, I am sure you are
surprised to hear this - no doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledores favorite
-- but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer
and the people who count have a very different - and probably more accurate - view of Potters
behavior. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get a
good idea of the way the wind is blowing -- and see if you can spot yours truly!
Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter, it could be very
damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school, too. As you
must be aware, given that our father escorted him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to court, Potter had a disciplinary hearing this
summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) did not come out of it looking too good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)
got off on a mere technicality, if you ask me, and many of the people Ive spoken to remain
convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) guilt.
It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter - I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) can be unbalanced and, for
all I know, violent - but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything else in
Potters behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores Umbridge, a truly
delightful woman who I know will be only too happy to advise you.
This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted above, Dumbledores regime at
Hogwarts may soon be over. Your loyalty, Ron, should be not to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), but to the school and the
Ministry. I am very sorry to hear that, so far, Professor Umbridge is encountering very little cooperation from staff as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the
Ministry so ardently desires -LRB-although she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) should find this easier from next week -- again, see
the Daily Prophet tomorrow!-RRB-. I shall say only this - a student who shows himself willing to help
Professor Umbridge now may be very well-placed for Head Boyship in a couple of years!
I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. It pains me to criticize our
parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the
dangerous crowd around Dumbledore. -LRB-If you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledores, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty
criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders.-RRB- I count myself very lucky to have
escaped the stigma of association with such people - the Minister really could not be more
gracious to me -- and I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the
misguided nature of our parents beliefs and actions, either. I sincerely hope that, in time, they
will realize how mistaken they were and I shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes.
Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly the bit about Harry Potter, and
congratulations again on becoming prefect.
Your brother,
Percy
Harry looked up at Ron.
``Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, trying to sound as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found the whole thing a joke, ``if you want to - er -
what is it?'' - he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) checked Percys letter - ``Oh yeah - severe ties with me, I swear I wont get violent.''
``Give it back,'' said Ron, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hand. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) is -'' Ron said jerkily, tearing Percys letter in half ``the worlds -'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tore it into quarters ``biggest -'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tore it into eighths ``git.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) threw the pieces into the fire.
``Come on, weve got to get this finished sometime before dawn,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said briskly to Harry,
pulling Professor Sinistras essay back towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).
Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face.
``Oh, give them here,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said abruptly.
``What?'' said Ron.
``Give them to me, Ill look through them and correct them,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said.
``Are you serious? Ah, Hermione, youre a life-saver,'' said Ron, ``what can I -?''
``What you can say is, promise well never leave our homework this late again,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said,
holding out both hands for their essays, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked slightly amused all the same.
``Thanks a million, Hermione,'' said Harry weakly, passing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) essay and sinking back into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) armchair, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes.
It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and
Crookshanks. The only sound was that of Hermiones quill scratching out sentences here and
there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) checked various facts in the reference books
strewn across the table. Harry was exhausted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) also felt an odd, sick, empty feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling
blackly in the heart of the fire.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) strange, even mad; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) knew that
the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) for months, but there was something
about seeing it written down like that in Percys writing, about knowing that Percy was advising
Ron to drop him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) and even to tell tales about him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) to Umbridge, that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) situation real to him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)
as nothing else had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) had known Percy for four years, had stayed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) house during the
summer holidays, shared a tent with him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) during the Quidditch World Cup, had even been
awarded full marks by him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament last year, yet now,
Percy thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) unbalanced and possibly violent.
And with a surge of sympathy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) godfather, Harry thought Sirius was probably the only
person he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew who could really understand how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt at the moment, because Sirius was in
the same situation. Nearly everyone in the wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer
and a great Voldemort supporter and he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years...
Harry blinked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there. It had
flashed into sight and vanished immediately. No... it could not have been... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had imagined it
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been thinking about Sirius...
``Okay, write that down,'' Hermione said to Ron, pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) essay and a sheet covered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) own writing back to Ron, ``then add this conclusion Ive written for you.''
``Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person Ive ever met,'' said Ron weakly, ``and if
Im ever rude to you again -<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>- Ill know youre back to normal,'' said Hermione. ``Harry, yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra, Europas covered in ice, not mice -
Harry?''
Harry had slid off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare
hearthrug, gazing into the flames.
``Er - Harry?'' said Ron uncertainly. ``Why are you down there?''
``Because Ive just seen Siriuss head in the fire,'' said Harry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spoke quite calmly; after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen Siriuss head in this very fire the previous year and
talked to it, too; nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could not be sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had really seen it this time... it had
vanished so quickly...
``Siriuss head?'' Hermione repeated. ``You mean like when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wanted to talk to you during the
Triwizard Tournament? But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wouldnt do that now, it would be too - Sirius!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) quill. There in the middle of the dancing flames
sat Siriuss head, long dark hair falling around his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) grinning face.
``I was starting to think youd go to bed before everyone else had disappeared,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said. ``Ive
been checking every hour.''
``Youve been popping into the fire every hour?'' Harry said, half-laughing.
``Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear.''
``But what if youd been seen?'' said Hermione anxiously.
``Well, I think a girl - first-year, by the look of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) - mightve got a glimpse of me earlier, but
dont worry'' Sirius said hastily, as Hermione clapped a hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth, ``I was gone the
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked back at me and Ill bet she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) just thought I was an oddly-shaped log or
something.''
``But, Sirius, this is taking an awful risk -'' Hermione began.
``You sound like Molly,'' said Sirius. ``This was the only way I could come up with of answering
Harrys letter without resorting to a code - and codes are breakable.''
At the mention of Harrys letter, Hermione and Ron both turned to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).
``You didnt say youd written to Sirius!'' said Hermione accusingly.
``I forgot,'' said Harry, which was perfectly true; h is meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven
everything before it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind. ``Dont look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way
anyone would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?''
``No, it was very good,'' said Sirius, smiling. ``Anyway, wed better be quick, just in case were
disturbed - your scar.''
``What about -?'' Ron began, but Hermione interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>). ``Well tell you afterwards. Go on,
Sirius.''
``Well, I know it cant be fun when it hurts, but we dont think its anything to really worry about. It kept aching all last year, didnt it?''
``Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion,''
said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermiones winces. ``So maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was just, I dunno,
really angry or something the night I had that detention.''
``Well, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s back its bound to hurt more often,'' said Sirius.
``So you dont think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me when I was in detention
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)?'' Harry asked.
``I doubt it,'' said Sirius. ``I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) by reputation and Im sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s no Death Eater -''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s foul enough to be one,'' said Harry darkly, and Ron and Hermione nodded vigorously in
agreement.
``Yes, but the world isnt split into good people and Death Eaters,'' said Sirius with a wry smile. ``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s a nasty piece of work, though -- you should hear Remus talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).''
``Does Lupin know her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)?'' asked Harry quickly, remembering Umbridges comments about
dangerous half-breeds during her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) first lesson.
``No,'' said Sirius, ``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it
almost impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Remus</b></font>) to get a job.''
Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) dislike of Umbridge
deepened even further.
``Whats she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) got against werewolves?'' said Hermione angrily.
``Scared of them, I expect,'' said Sirius, smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) indignation. ``Apparently she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) loathes part humans; she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year, too. Imagine
wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher
on the loose.''
Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset.
``Sirius!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said reproachfully. ``Honestly, if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher, Im sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Remus</b></font>)d respond. After all, you are the only member of his (<font color='blue'><b>Remus</b></font>) family he (<font color='blue'><b>Remus</b></font>)s got left, and Professor
Dumbledore said -''
``So, what are Umbridges lessons like?'' Sirius interrupted. ``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) training you all to kill half-breeds?''
``No,'' said Harry, ignoring Hermiones affronted look at being cut off in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) defense of Kreacher. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s not letting us use magic at all!''
``All we do is read the stupid textbook,'' said Ron.
``Ah, well, that figures,'' said Sirius. ``Our information from inside the Ministry is that Fudge
doesnt want you trained in combat.''
``Trained in combat!'' repeated Harry incredulously. ``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) think were doing here,
forming some sort of wizard army?''
``Thats exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) thinks youre doing,'' said Sirius, ``or, rather, thats exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s
afraid Dumbledores doing - forming his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) own private army, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) will be able to take on
the Ministry of Magic.''
There was a pause at this, then Ron said, ``Thats the most stupid thing Ive ever heard, including
all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with.''
``So were being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared
well use spells against the Ministry?'' said Hermione, looking furious.
``Yep,'' said Sirius. ``Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s getting
more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day. Its a matter of time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) has Dumbledore
arrested on some trumped-up charge.''
This reminded Harry of Percys letter.
``Dyou know if theres going to be anything about Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet tomorrow?
Rons brother Percy reckons there will be -''
``I dont know,'' said Sirius, ``I havent seen anyone from the Order all weekend, theyre all busy.
Its just been Kreacher and me here.''
There was a definite note of bitterness in Siriuss voice.
``So you havent had any news about Hagrid, either?''
``Ah...'' said Sirius, ``well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was supposed to be back by now, no ones sure whats happened to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).'' Then, seeing their stricken faces, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) added quickly, ``But Dumbledores not worried, so
dont you three get yourselves in a state; Im sure Hagrids fine.''
``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was supposed to be back by now...'' said Hermione in a small, anxious voice.
``Madame Maxime was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), weve been in touch with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) says they got separated
on the journey home - but theres nothing to suggest he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s hurt or - well, nothing to suggest he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s
not perfectly okay.''
Unconvinced, Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged worried looks.
``Listen, dont go asking too many questions about Hagrid,'' said Sirius hastily, ``itll just draw
even more attention to the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s not back and I know Dumbledore doesnt want that.
Hagrids tough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)ll be okay.'' And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius added,
``Whens your next Hogsmeade weekend, anyway? I was thinking, we got away with the dog
disguise at the station, didnt we? I thought I could --''
``NO!'' said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly.
``Sirius, didnt you see the Daily Prophet?'' said Hermione anxiously.
``Oh, that,'' said Sirius, grinning, ``theyre always guessing where I am, they havent really got a
clue -''
``Yeah, but we think this time they have, said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Something Malfoy said on the train made
us think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew it was you, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father was on the platform, Sirius - you know, Lucius
Malfoy - so dont come up here, whatever you do. If Malfoy recognizes you again -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right, all right, Ive got the point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) looked most displeased. <div class="bookquote">``Just an idea,
thought you might like to get together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I would, I just dont want you chucked back in Azkaban!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a crease between his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) sunken
eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Youre less like your father than I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said finally, a definite coolness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``The risk wouldve been what made it fun for James.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Id better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, but Harry
was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was lying. <div class="bookquote">``Ill write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire, then, shall I? If you can stand to risk it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>There was a tiny pop, and the place where Siriuss head had been was flickering flame once
more.
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
The Hogwarts High Inquisitor
They had expected to have to comb Hermiones Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Umbridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline.
MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM
DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED
FIRST EVER HIGH INQUISITOR
<div class="bookquote">``Umbridge - Inquisitor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Harry darkly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) half-eaten piece of toast slipping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``What does that maen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione rad aloud:
<div class="bookquote">``In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an
unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts for some time, said junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Assistant</b></font>) is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve.
<div class="bookquote">``This is not the first time in recent weeks that the Minister, Cornelius Fudge, has used new laws
to effect improvements at the wizarding school. As recently as August 30th, Educational Decree
Number Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the current Headmaster being
unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the Ministry should select an appropriate
person. Thats how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts, said Weasley last night. Dumboldore couldnt find anyone so the Minister put in Umbridge, and of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s been an immediate success --''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s been a WHAT?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry loudly.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait, theres more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione grimly.
''--an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts
and providing the Minister with on-the-ground feedback about whats really happening at
Hogwarts.
``It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the passing of Educational
Decree Number Twenty-three, which creates the new position of Hogwarts High Inquisitor.
''This is an exciting new phase in the Ministers plan to get to grips with what some are calling the falling standards at Hogwarts, said Weasley. The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) own teaching post and we are delighted to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) has accepted.
``The Ministrys new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at
Hogwarts.
I feel much easier in my mind now that I know Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and
objective evaluation, said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) Wiltshire mansion last
night. Many of us with our childrens best interests at heart have been concerned about some of
Dumbledores eccentric decisions in the last few years and are glad to know that the Ministry is
keeping an eye on the situation.
``Among those eccentric decisions are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the employment of werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid and delusional ex-Auror, Mad - Eye Moody.
``Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the
International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up
to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts
''I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step towards ensuring that Hogwarts has a
headmaster in whom we can all repose our confidence, said a Ministry insider last night.
``Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the
introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
<div class="bookquote">''Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudges office, said Madam Marchbanks. This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus Dumbledore.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Hogwarts/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft/Hogwarts School</b></font>)</div>-LRB-For a full account of Madam Marchbankss alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to
page seventeen.-RRB-''
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.
``So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed this Decree and forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
on us! And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)s given her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) the power to inspect the other teachers!'' Hermione was breathing
fast and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes were very bright. ``I cant believe this. Its outrageous!''
``I know it is,'' said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right hand, clenched on the table-top, and saw
the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to cut into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skin.
But a grin was unfurling on Rons face.
``What?'' said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Oh, I cant wait to see McGonagall inspected,'' said Ron happily. ``Umbridge wont know whats hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).''
``Well, come on,'' said Hermione, jumping up, ``wed better get going, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s inspecting Binnss
class we dont want to be late...''
But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull
as the previous Monday, nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) in Snapes dungeon when they arrived for double Potions,
where Harrys moonstone essay was handed back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with a large, spiky black D scrawled
in an upper corner.
``I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your
OWL,'' said Snape with a smirk, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) swept among them, passing back their homework. ``This
should give you a realiztic idea of what to expect in the examination.''
Snape reached the front of the class and turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) heel to face them.
``The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this
been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this weeks essay on the
various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those
dunces who get a D.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, ``Some people got a D? Ha!''
Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had received; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slid
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moonstone essay back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag as quickly as possible, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would rather keep
that information private.
Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) this lesson, Harry read and reread every line
of instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Strengthening
Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermiones but it was at least blue rather
than pink, like Nevilles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) delivered a flask of it to Snapes desk at the end of the lesson
with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief.
``Well, that wasnt as bad as last week, was it?'' said Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of
the dungeon and made their way across the Entrance Hall towards lunch. ``And the homework
didnt go too badly, either, did it?''
When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pressed on, ``I mean, all right, I didnt expect the top
grade, not if he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s marking to OWL standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage,
wouldnt you say?''
Harry made a non-committal noise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat.
``Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, weve got plenty of time to improve,
but the grades were getting now are a sort of baseline, arent they? Something we can build
on...''
They sat down together at the Gryffindor table.
``Obviously, Id have been thrilled if Id got an O -''
``Hermione,'' said Ron sharply ``if you want to know what grades we got, ask.''
``I dont - I didnt mean - well, if you want to tell me -''
``I got a P,'' said Ron, ladling soup into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bowl. ``Happy?''
``Well, thats nothing to be ashamed of,'' said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George
and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harrys right. ``Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.''
``But,'' said Hermione, ``doesnt P stand for...''
``Poor, yeah,'' said Lee Jordan. ``Still, better than D, isnt it? Dreadful?''
Harry felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) roll. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) emerged
from this he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about OWL grades.
``So top grades O for Outstanding,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was saying, and then theres A-''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, E,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>George corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``E for Exceeds Expectations. And Ive always thought Fred and I shouldve got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>They all laughed except Hermione, who ploughed on, <div class="bookquote">``So, after E its A for Acceptable, and thats the last pass grade, isnt it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) soup, transferring it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mouth and swallowing it whole.
<div class="bookquote">``Then you get P for Poor-''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron raised both his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) arms in mock celebration - <div class="bookquote">``and D for Dreadful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And then T,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>George reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``T?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>asked Hermione, looking appalled. <div class="bookquote">``Even lower than a D? What on earth does that stand for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Troll'' (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>, said George promptly.
Harry laughed again, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not sure whether or not George was joking. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) imagined
trying to conceal from Hermione that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had received Ts in all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) OWLs and immediately
resolved to work harder from now on.
<div class="bookquote">``You lot had an inspected lesson yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred asked them.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione at once. <div class="bookquote">``Have you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just now, before lunch,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``Charms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What was it like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Hermione asked together.
Fred shrugged.
<div class="bookquote">``Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard. You know what
Flitwicks like, he (<font color='blue'><b>Troll</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) like a guest, didnt seem to bother him (<font color='blue'><b>Troll</b></font>) at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) didnt say much.
Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) they
were really good, that was it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cant see old Flitwick getting marked down,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Troll</b></font>) usually gets everyone through
their exams all right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whove you got this afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred asked Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Trelawney -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A T if ever I saw one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- and Umbridge herself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``Angelinall do
her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room
when Ron elbowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) in the ribs and, looking round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) saw Professor Umbridge emerging
through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been talking cheerily fell silent at once.
The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about
handing out copies of The Dream Oracle, look round.
<div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wide smile. <div class="bookquote">``You
received my note, I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) back on Professor
Umbridge and continued to give out books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back
of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind
Professor Trelawneys seat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) then sat down, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) flowery bag and
looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin.
Professor Trelawney pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) shawls tight about her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) with slightly trembling hands and
surveyed the class through her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hugely magnifying lenses.
<div class="bookquote">``We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said in a brave attempt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
usual mystic tones, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice shook slightly. <div class="bookquote">``Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each
others latest night-time visions with the aid of the Oracle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) made as though to sweep back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) seat, saw Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it,
and immediately veered left towards Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion
about Parvatis most recent dream.
Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was already
making notes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard. After a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) got to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) feet and began to pace the
room in Trelawneys wake, listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) conversations with students and posing questions
here and there. Harry bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head hurriedly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) book.
<div class="bookquote">``Think of a dream, quick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told Ron, <div class="bookquote">``in case the old toad comes our way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did it last time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron protested, <div class="bookquote">``its your turn, you tell me one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I dunno...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over
the last few days. <div class="bookquote">``Lets say I dreamed I was... drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, thatll
do...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron chortled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) Dream Oracle.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, weve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the
subject... would that be drowning or cauldron or Snape?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It doesnt matter, pick any of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, chancing a glance behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Professor
Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawneys shoulder making notes while the
Divination teacher questioned Neville about his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) dream diary.
<div class="bookquote">``What night did you dream this again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron said, immersed in calculations.
<div class="bookquote">``I dunno, last night, whenever you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), trying to listen to what Umbridge was
saying to Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) and Ron now. Professor
Umbridge was making another note on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking
extremely put out.
<div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, <div class="bookquote">``youve been in this post how long, exactly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney scowled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to
protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) could reasonably
ignore it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said in a deeply resentful tone, <div class="bookquote">``Nearly sixteen years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite a period,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard. <div class="bookquote">``So it was Professor
Dumbledore who appointed you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney shortly.
Professor Umbridge made another note.
<div class="bookquote">``And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) head a little higher.
Another note on the clipboard.
<div class="bookquote">``But I think - correct me if I am mistaken - that you are the first in your family since Cassandra
to be possessed of Second Sight?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``These things often skip - er - three generations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney.
Professor Umbridges toadlike smile widened.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said sweetly, making yet another note. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if you could just predict
something for me, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) looked up enquiringly, still smiling.
Professor Trelawney stiffened as though unable to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``I dont understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
said, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) scrawny neck.
<div class="bookquote">``Id like you to make a prediction for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge very clearly.
Harry and Ron were not the only people now watching and listening sneakily from behind their
books. Most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) drew herself up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) full height, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) beads and bangles clinking.
<div class="bookquote">``The Inner Eye does not See upon command!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said in scandalized tones.
<div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard.
<div class="bookquote">``I - but - but... wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) usual ethereal
voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger.
<div class="bookquote">``I... I think I do see something... something that concerns you... why, I sense something...
something dark... some grave peril...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Umbridge who continued to smile
blandly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), eyebrows raised.
<div class="bookquote">``I am afraid... I am afraid that you are in grave danger!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney finished
dramatically.
There was a pause. Professor Umbridge surveyed Professor Trelawney.
<div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said softly, scribbling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard once more. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if thats really the best you can do...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) chest heaving.
Harry caught Rons eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was: they both
knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge
so much that they felt very much on Trelawneys side - until she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) swooped down on them a few
seconds later, that is.
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, snapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) long fingers under Harrys nose, uncharacteristically brisk. <div class="bookquote">``Let
me see the start youve made on your dream diary, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had interpreted Harrys dreams at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice -LRB-all of which, even the
ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
feeling much less sympathetic towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet
away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) descended the silver ladder
first and was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson
ten minutes later.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room. Harry and Ron told
Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all
took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions
Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell.
<div class="bookquote">``Wands away''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) instructed them all with a smile, and those people who had been hopeful
enough to take them out, sadly returned them to their bags. <div class="bookquote">``As we finished Chapter One last
lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence Chapter Two,
Common Defensive Theories and their Derivation. There will be no need to talk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Still smiling her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wide, self-satisfied smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) sat down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) desk. The class gave an audible
sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough
chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this years lessons and was on the point of
checking the contents page when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) noticed that Hermione had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand in the air again.
Professor Umbridge had noticed, too, and what was more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) seemed to have worked out a
strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had not noticed Hermione
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) got to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face to face, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, <div class="bookquote">``What is it this time, Miss
Granger?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ive already read Chapter Two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Well then, proceed to Chapter Three.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ive read that too. Ive read the whole book.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) poise almost instantly.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counter-jinxes in Chapter
Fifteen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Slinkhard</b></font>) says that counter-jinxes are improperly named,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione promptly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Slinkhard</b></font>) says - jinx is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) eyebrows and Harry knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was impressed, against her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) will.
<div class="bookquote">``But I disagree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione continued.
Professor Umbridges eyebrows rose a little higher and her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) gaze became distinctly colder.
<div class="bookquote">``You disagree?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) repeated.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear,
carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Slinkhard
doesnt like jinxes, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Slinkhard</b></font>)? But, I think they can be very useful when theyre used defensively.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you do, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Im afraid it is Mr. Slinkhards opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom,
Miss Granger.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But -''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione began.
<div class="bookquote">``That is enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) walked back to the front of the class and stood
before them, all the jauntiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was an outbreak of muttering at this.
<div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont you get involved!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered urgently to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge smoothly. <div class="bookquote">``I am
here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to
give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your previous teachers in
this subject may have allowed you more license, but as none of them - with the possible
exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age appropriate subjects - would have passed a Ministry inspection -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry loudly, <div class="bookquote">``there was just that minor drawback of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then -
<div class="bookquote">``I think another weeks detentions would do you some good, Mr. Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge sleekly.
The cut on the back of Harrys hand had barely healed and, by the following morning, it was
bleeding again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not complain during the evenings detention; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was determined not to
give Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound
escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lips, though the cut deepened with every letter.
The very worst part of this second weeks worth of detentions was, just as George had predicted,
Angelinas reaction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) cornered him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on
Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of
them from the staff table.
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Professor - he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)s gone and landed himself in detention again -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whats this, Potter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Detention? From
whom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``From Professor Umbridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagalls beady, square-framed eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you telling me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws
behind them could not hear, <div class="bookquote">``that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper
in Professor Umbridges class again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered, speaking to the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for serious trouble! Another five points
from Gryffindor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But - what -? Professor, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said, furious at this injustice, <div class="bookquote">``Im already being punished
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), why do you have to take points as well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor
McGonagall tartly. <div class="bookquote">``No, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson,
you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team
captaincy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall strode back towards the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest
disgust and stalked away, upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flung himself on to the bench beside Ron, fuming.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)s taken points off Gryffindor because Im having my hand sliced open every night! How is
that fair, how?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know, mate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon on to Harrys plate, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)s bang out of
order.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) Daily Prophet and said nothing.
<div class="bookquote">``You think McGonagall was right, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge
obscuring Hermiones face.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) hadnt taken points from you, but I think she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)s right to warn you not to lose your
temper with Umbridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermiones voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the
front page, clearly giving some kind of speech.
Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
forgot about being cross with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). Professor Umbridge and her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard were sitting in a corner
and the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) drove the memory of breakfast right out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. <div class="bookquote">``Lets see Umbridge get what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) deserves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
knew Professor Umbridge was there.
<div class="bookquote">``That will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said and silence fell immediately. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework - Miss Brown, please take this box of mice - dont be silly, girl, they wont hurt you - and hand one to each student -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hem, hem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had used to
interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>). Seamus
handed back Harrys essay; Harry took it without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and saw, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) relief, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had managed an A.
<div class="bookquote">``Right then, everyone, listen closely - Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put
you in detention - most of you have now successfully Vanished your snails and even those who
were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell. Today, we shall be -''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hem, hem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line.
<div class="bookquote">``I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time
of your inspec--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said
Professor McGonagall, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) back firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students
exchanged looks of glee. <div class="bookquote">``As I was saying: today, we shall be practicing the altogether more
difficult Vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hem, hem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, <div class="bookquote">``how you
expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I
do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had just been slapped in the face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) did not speak,
but straightened the parchment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard and began scribbling furiously.
Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more.
<div class="bookquote">``As I was saying: the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal
to be Vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse,
as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with
your mind on your dinner. So - you know the incantation, let me see what you can do...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered to Ron
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breath, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was grinning - his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) anger with Professor McGonagall had quite
evaporated.
Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had followed
Professor Trelawney; perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) realized Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) did,
however, take many more notes while sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) corner, and when Professor McGonagall
finally told them all to pack away, she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) rose with a grim expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, its a start,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, holding up a long wriggling mouse-tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around.
As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teachers desk;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to
eavesdrop.
<div class="bookquote">``How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Thirty-nine years this December,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) bag shut.
Professor Umbridge made a note.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, in a coldly indifferent voice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) strode off
towards the door. <div class="bookquote">``Hurry up, you three,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) added, sweeping Harry, Ron and Hermione before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
Harry could not help giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) a faint smile and could have sworn he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) received one in return.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had thought that the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would see Umbridge would be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) detention that evening,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was wrong. When they walked down the lawns towards the Forest for Care of Magical
Creatures, they found her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly-Plank.
<div class="bookquote">``You do not usually take this class, is that correct?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) ask as they arrived at the
trestle table where the group of captive Bowtruckles were scrabbling around for woodlice like so
many living twigs.
<div class="bookquote">``Quite correct,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) back and bouncing on the balls
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and
Goyle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry.
<div class="bookquote">``Hmm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice, though Harry could still hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) quite
clearly. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder - the Headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the
matter - can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrids very extended leave of absence?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly and watch Umbridge and Grubbly-Plank closely.
<div class="bookquote">``Fraid I cant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. <div class="bookquote">``Dont know anything more about it than
you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks teaching work. I
accepted. Thats as much as I know. Well... shall I get started then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, scribbling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard.
Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered amongst the students, questioning
them on magical creatures. Most people were able to answer well and Harrys spirits lifted
somewhat; at least the class was not letting Hagrid down.
<div class="bookquote">``Overall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-Planks side after a lengthy
interrogation of Dean Thomas, <div class="bookquote">``how do you, as a temporary member of staff- an objective
outsider, I suppose you might say -- how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive
enough support from the school management?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dean/Dean Thomas/Thomas</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, Dumbledores excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Im very happy
with the way things are run, very happy indeed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard and went on, <div class="bookquote">``And
what are you planning to cover with this class this year - assuming, of course, that Professor
Hagrid does not return?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Ill take them through the creatures that most often come up in OWL,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor
Grubbly-Plank. <div class="bookquote">``Not much left to do - theyve studied unicorns and Nifflers, I thought wed
cover Porlocks and Kneazles, make sure they can recognize Crups and Knarls, you know...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you seem to know what youre doing, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, making a
very obvious tick on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) put on you and liked it
even less when she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) next question to Goyle. <div class="bookquote">``Now, I hear there have been injuries in this
class?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Goyle</b></font>)</div>Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question.
<div class="bookquote">``That was me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I was slashed by a Hippogriff.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A Hippogriff?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically.
<div class="bookquote">``Only because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry angrily.
Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) head slowly in Harrys
direction.
<div class="bookquote">``Another nights detention, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``Well, thank you very much, Professor
Grubbly-Plank, I think thats all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection
within ten days.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jolly good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle.
It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridges office that night, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand now bleeding so
severely that it was staining the scarf he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had wrapped around it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) expected the common room
to be empty when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was
pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical.
<div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``soak your hand
in that, its a solution of strained and pickled Murtlap tentacles, it should help.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Harry placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of
relief. Crookshanks curled around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs, purring loudly, then leapt into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lap and settled
down.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshankss ears with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left hand.
<div class="bookquote">``I still reckon you should complain about this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron in a low voice.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry flatly.
<div class="bookquote">``McGonagall would go nuts if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew --''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) probably would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry dully. <div class="bookquote">``And how long do you reckon itd take Umbridge
to pass another decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked
immediately?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth to retort but nothing came out and, after a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) closed it again,
defeated.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s an awful woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a small voice. <div class="bookquote">``Awful. You know, I was just saying
to Ron when you came in... weve got to do something about her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suggested poison,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron grimly.
<div class="bookquote">``No... I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) is, and how were not going to learn
any Defense from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, what can we do about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, yawning. <div class="bookquote">``Its too late, isnt it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s got the job,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s here to stay. Fudgell make sure of that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione tentatively. <div class="bookquote">``You know, I was thinking today...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shot a slightly
nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking that - maybe the times come when
we should just - just do it ourselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do what ourselves?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry suspiciously, still floating his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand in the essence of Murtlap
tentacles.
<div class="bookquote">``Well - learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Come off it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>groaned Ron. <div class="bookquote">``You want us to do extra work? Dyou realize Harry and I are
behind on homework again and its only the second week?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But this is much more important than homework!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
Harry and Ron goggled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I didnt think there was anything in the universe more important than homework!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont be silly, of course there is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that SPEW usually inspired in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Its
about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridges first lesson, for whats waiting for us
out there. Its about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we dont learn anything for a
whole year -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We cant do much by ourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron in a defeated voice. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, all right, we can go and
look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I agree, weve gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said
Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct
us if were going wrong.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If youre talking about Lupin...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry began.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no, Im not talking about Lupin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>)s too busy with the Order and,
anyway, the most we could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) is during Hogsmeade weekends and thats not nearly often
enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, frowning at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
Hermione heaved a very deep sigh.
<div class="bookquote">``Isnt it obvious?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Im talking about you, Harry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a moments silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron, and the
fire guttered.
<div class="bookquote">``About me what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Im talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they
sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like SPEW to Harrys
consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Thats an idea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whats an idea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``You,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Teaching us to do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leg.
<div class="bookquote">``But Im not a teacher, I cant -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry, youre the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. <div class="bookquote">``No Im not, youve beaten me in every test -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Actually, I havent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione coolly. <div class="bookquote">``You beat me in our third year - the only year we
both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But Im not talking about test
results, Harry. Think what youve done!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How dyou mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know what, Im not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron said to Hermione,
smirking slightly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) turned to Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Lets think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. <div class="bookquote">``Uh... first year - you saved the
Sorcerers Stone from You-Know-Who.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that was luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``it wasnt skill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Second year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``you killed the Basilisk and destroyed Riddle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, but if Fawkes hadnt turned up, I -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Third year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, louder still, <div class="bookquote">``you fought off about a hundred Dementors at once -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadnt -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Last year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron said, almost shouting now, <div class="bookquote">``you fought off You-Know-Who again-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now.
<div class="bookquote">``Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck - I
didnt know what I was doing half the time, I didnt plan any of it, I just did whatever I could
think of, and I nearly always had help -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) temper rise; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasnt even sure why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was feeling so angry.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasnt I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said heatedly.
<div class="bookquote">``I know what went on, all right? And I didnt get through any of that because I was brilliant at
Defense Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because - because help came at the right time,
or because I guessed right - but I just blundered through it all, I didnt have a clue what I was
doing - STOP LAUGHING!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The bowl of Murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) became aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
feet, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldnt remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa. Ron
and Hermiones smiles had vanished.
<div class="bookquote">``You dont know what its like! You - neither of you - youve never had to face him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), have you?
You think its just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), like youre in class
or something? The whole time youre sure you know theres nothing between you and dying
except your own - your own brain or guts or whatever - like you can think straight when you
know youre about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die
- theyve never taught us that in their classes, what its like to deal with things like that - and you
two sit there acting like Im a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid,
like he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) messed up -- you just dont get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have
been if Voldemort hadnt needed me -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We werent saying anything like that, mate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking aghast. <div class="bookquote">``We werent having a go at Diggory, we didnt - youve got the wrong end of the -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said timidly, <div class="bookquote">``dont you see? This... this is exactly why we need you... we need to
know what its r-really like... facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... facing V-Voldemort.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had ever said Voldemorts name and it was this, more than anything else,
that calmed Harry. Still breathing hard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sank back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair, becoming aware as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did so
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand was throbbing horribly again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not smashed the bowl of Murtlap
essence.
<div class="bookquote">``Well... think about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry could not think of anything to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was feeling ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) outburst already. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
nodded, hardly aware of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was agreeing to. Hermione stood up.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Im off to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, in a voice that was clearly as natural as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could make it.
<div class="bookquote">``Erm... night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron had gotten to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet, too.
<div class="bookquote">``Coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said awkwardly to Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``In... in a minute. Ill just clear this up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left.
<div class="bookquote">``Reparo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered, pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand at the broken pieces of china. They flew back
together, good as new, but there was no returning the Murtlap essence to the bowl.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was suddenly so tired he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was tempted to sink back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) armchair and sleep there, but
instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forced himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet and followed Ron upstairs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) restless night was punctuated
once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) awoke next day with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) scar
prickling again.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
In the Hogs Head
Hermione made no mention of Harry giving Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons for two
whole weeks after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) original suggestion. Harrys detentions with Umbridge were finally over
-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand would ever fade entirely-RRB-;
Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all
three of them had managed to Vanish their mice in Transfiguration -LRB-Hermione had actually
progressed to Vanishing kittens-RRB-, before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery
evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up
potion ingredients for Snape.
<div class="bookquote">``I was wondering,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione said suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``whether youd thought any more about Defense
Against the Dark Arts, Harry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Course I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry grumpily, <div class="bookquote">``cant forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I meant the idea Ron and I had -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Ron cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) an alarmed, threatening kind of look. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
frowned at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">''- Oh, all right, the idea I had then - about you teaching us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Harry did not answer at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not want to say what was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an
insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had found
himself thinking about the spells that had served him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) best in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) various encounters with Dark
creatures and Death Eaters - found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons...
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Death Eaters</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said slowly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could no longer pretend to find Asiatic Anti-Venoms interesting, <div class="bookquote">``yeah, I - Ive thought about it a bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione eagerly.
<div class="bookquote">``I dunno,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, playing for time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up at Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought it was a good idea from the start,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this
conversation now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was sure Harry was not going to start shouting again.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair.
<div class="bookquote">``You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didnt you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione gently, <div class="bookquote">``but all the same, theres no point pretending that youre not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year
who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards cant, Viktor always said -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Ron looked round at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) so fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) appeared to crick his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) neck. Rubbing it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Yeah? What
did Vicky say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ho ho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a bored voice. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>ho</b></font>) said Harry knew how to do stuff even he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didnt,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in the final year at Durmstrang.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously.
<div class="bookquote">``Youre not still in contact with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So what if I am''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione coolly, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face was a little pink. <div class="bookquote">``I can have a pen-pal
if I -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didnt only want to be your pen-pal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron accusingly.
Hermione shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ron, who was continuing to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>),
said to Harry, <div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you think? Will you teach us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just you and Ron, yeah?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking a mite anxious again. <div class="bookquote">``Well... now, dont fly off the handle
again, Harry, please... but I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean,
were talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort. Oh, dont be pathetic, Ron. It
doesnt seem fair if we dont offer the chance to other people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry considered this for a moment, then said, <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would
want to be taught by me. Im a nutter, remember?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what
youve got to say''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione seriously. <div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) leaned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) - Ron, who was still watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) with a frown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face, leaned forwards to listen too - <div class="bookquote">``you know the first
weekend in Octobers a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone whos
interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why do we have to do it outside school?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was
copying, <div class="bookquote">``I dont think Umbridge would be very happy if she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) found out what we were up to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing
worrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had appeared in the fire at the
beginning of September; Harry knew they had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) angry by saying they didnt want him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
to come - but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and
turn up anyway. What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street
towards them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy?
<div class="bookquote">``Well, you cant blame him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for wanting to get out and about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, when Harry discussed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fears with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s been on the run for over two years, hasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and I know that cant have been a laugh, but at least he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was free, wasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)? And now he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s just shut up all the time with that ghastly elf.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on Kreacher.
<div class="bookquote">``The trouble is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said to Harry, <div class="bookquote">``until V-Voldemort - oh, for heavens sake, Ron - comes out
into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)? I mean, the stupid Ministry isnt
going to realize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledores been telling the truth about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) all along. And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again, itll be obvious Sirius isnt one... I mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) hasnt got the Mark, for one thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)d be stupid enough to turn up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron bracingly. <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledored go mad if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) doesnt like what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) hears.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, <div class="bookquote">``Listen, Ron and I have been sounding
out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and
there are a couple who seem interested. Weve told them to meet us in Hogsmeade.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry vaguely, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind still on Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont worry, Harry''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Youve got enough on your plate without Sirius,
too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was quite right, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was barely keeping up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) homework, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was
doing much better now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was no longer spending every evening in detention with
Umbridge. Ron was even further behind with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) work than Harry, because while they both had
Quidditch practice twice a week, Ron also had his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) prefect duties. However, Hermione, who was
taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) homework but was also
finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was getting better; it was now
almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks.
The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. After breakfast they queued up in
front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from
their parents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it
hadnt been for Sirius, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) would not have been going at all.
When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of
something from Harry. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave a curt nod that set his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jowls aquiver again and Harry
walked on, out on to the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.
<div class="bookquote">``Er - why was Filch sniffing you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Ron, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), Harry and Hermione set off at a brisk pace
down the wide drive to the gates.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry with a small laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I
forgot to tell you...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) recounted the story of sending his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later,
demanding to see the letter. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting,
much more, indeed, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did himself.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who tipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dunno,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, shrugging. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe Malfoy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)d think it was a laugh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the
road into the village, the wind whipping their hair into their eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Malfoy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, skeptically. <div class="bookquote">``Well... yes... maybe...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are we going, anyway?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked. <div class="bookquote">``The Three Broomsticks?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh - no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, coming out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) reverie, <div class="bookquote">``no, its always packed and really noisy.
Ive told the others to meet us in the Hogs Head, that other pub, you know the one, its not on
the main road. I think its a bit... you know... dodgy... but students dont normally go in there,
so I dont think well be overheard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>They walked down the main street past Zonkos Wizarding Joke Shop, where they were not
surprised to see Fred, George and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at
regular intervals, and turned up a side-street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered
wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture on it of a wild boars
severed head, leaking blood on to the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they
approached. All three of them hesitated outside the door.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, slightly nervously. Harry led the way inside.
It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming
warmth and cleanliness. The Hogs Head bar comprised one small, dingy and very dirty room
that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so
encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with
the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be
compressed earth, though as Harry stepped on to it he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized that there was stone beneath what
seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.
Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first year: <div class="bookquote">``Yeh get a lot o funny folk in
the Hogs Head''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had said, explaining how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had won a dragons egg from a hooded stranger
there. At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
face hidden throughout their encounter; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw that keeping your face hidden was
something of a fashion in the Hogs Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was
wrapped in dirty grey bandages, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some
smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth; two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a
table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them Dementors if they had not been
talking in strong Yorkshire accents, and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with
a thick, black veil that fell to her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) toes. They could just see the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) nose because it caused
the veil to protrude slightly.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont know about this, Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was looking
particularly at the heavily veiled witch. <div class="bookquote">``Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure.
<div class="bookquote">``Umbridge is shorter than that woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``And anyway, even if Umbridge does
come in here theres nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) can do to stop us, Harry, because Ive double- and triplechecked
the school rules. Were not out of bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hogs Head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) advised me
strongly to bring our own glasses. And Ive looked up everything I can think of about study
groups and homework groups and theyre definitely allowed. I just dont think its a good idea if
we parade what were doing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry dryly, <div class="bookquote">``especially as its not exactly a homework group youre planning, is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>The barman sidled towards them out of a back room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was a grumpy-looking old man with a
great deal of long grey hair and beard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grunted.
<div class="bookquote">``Three Butterbeers, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
slammed on the bar.
<div class="bookquote">``Six Sickles,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Ill get them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The barmans eyes traveled over
Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned away and deposited Harrys
money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry, Ron
and Hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around. The man
in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knuckles and received another smoking
drink from the barman.
<div class="bookquote">``You know what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. <div class="bookquote">``We could order
anything we liked in here. I bet that bloke would sell us anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>bloke</b></font>) wouldnt care. Ive always
wanted to try Firewhisky -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You - are - a -prefect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>snarled Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, the smile fading from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So, who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Butterbeer and taking a swig.
<div class="bookquote">``Just a couple of people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione repeated, checking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) watch and looking anxiously towards the door. <div class="bookquote">``I told them to be here about now and Im sure they all know where it is - oh, look, this might be them now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a
moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people.
First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma
Patil with -LRB-Harrys stomach did a back-flip-RRB- Cho and one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) usually-giggling girlfriends, then
-LRB-on her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) own and looking so dreamy she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) might have walked in by accident-RRB- Luna Lovegood; then
Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan,
Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back whose
name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was pretty sure were called Anthony
Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy
with an upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff
Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan,
all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonkos merchandise.
<div class="bookquote">``A couple of people?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``A couple of people?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione happily, <div class="bookquote">``Ron, do you want to pull up
some more chairs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it
had never been washed. Possibly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pub so full.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) companions quickly, <div class="bookquote">``could we have...
twenty-five Butterbeers, please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>The barman glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) for a moment, then, throwing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) rag irritably as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had
been interrupted in something very important, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) started passing up dusty Butterbeers from under
the bar.
<div class="bookquote">``Cheers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, handing them out. <div class="bookquote">``Cough up, everyone, I havent got enough gold for all of
these...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in
their robes to find coins. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the
horrible thought occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) that they might be expecting some kind of speech, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
rounded on Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``What have you been telling people?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``What are they expecting?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ive told you, they just want to hear what youve got to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione soothingly; but
Harry continued to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) so furiously that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) added quickly, <div class="bookquote">``you dont have to do
anything yet, Ill speak to them first.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hi, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>).
Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just
smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) and sat down on Rons right. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did
not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that, given her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) would not be here at all.
In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron and Hermione, some looking
rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had
pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Er,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. <div class="bookquote">``Well - er - hi.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>The group focused its attention on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to
Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well... erm... well, you know why youre here. Erm... well, Harry here had the idea - I mean''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Harry had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) a sharp look-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I had the idea - that it might be good if people who wanted
to study Defense Against the Dark Arts - and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish
that Umbridge is doing with us -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Hermiones voice became suddenly much stronger and more
confident-RRB- <div class="bookquote">''- because nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts -''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened-RRB- <div class="bookquote">''- Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, <div class="bookquote">``And by that I mean learning how to defend
ourselves properly, not just in theory but doing the real spells -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL too, though, I bet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Michael
Corner, who was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) closely.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione at once. <div class="bookquote">``But more than that, I want to be properly trained in
defense because... because...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) took a great breath and finished, <div class="bookquote">``because Lord Voldemort is
back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The reaction was immediate and predictable. Chos friend shrieked and slopped Butterbeer down
herself; Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch; Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave
an odd yelp that he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even
eagerly, at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well... thats the plan, anyway''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``If you want to join us, we need to decide how
were going to -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wheres the proof You-Know-Whos back?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hufflepuff</b></font>)</div>said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather
aggressive voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Dumbledore believes it -''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione began.
<div class="bookquote">``You mean, Dumbledore believes him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the blond boy, nodding at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, rather rudely.
<div class="bookquote">``Zacharias Smith,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, <div class="bookquote">``and I think weve got the right to know exactly what makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) say You-Know-Whos back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, intervening swiftly, <div class="bookquote">``thats really not what this meeting was supposed to
be about -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its okay, Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
It had just dawned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) why there were so many people there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought Hermione should
have seen this coming. Some of these people - maybe even most of them - had turned up in the
hopes of hearing Harrys story firsthand.
<div class="bookquote">``What makes me say You-Know-Whos back?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) repeated, looking Zacharias straight in the
face. <div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you
didnt believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), you wont believe me, and Im not wasting an afternoon trying to convince
anyone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke. Harry had the impression
that even the barman was listening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag, making it
steadily dirtier.
Zacharias said dismissively, <div class="bookquote">``All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got
killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggorys body back to Hogwarts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) didnt
give us details, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) didnt tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think wed all like to know
-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Zacharias Smith/Zacharias/Smith</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If youve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I cant help
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did
not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes from Zacharias Smiths aggressive face, and was determined not to look at Cho.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if thats what youre here for, you might as well clear out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) cast an angry look in Hermiones direction. This was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) felt, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) fault; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had decided to
display him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just how wild his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>)
story was. But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) continued to
gaze intently at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) voice very high-pitched again. <div class="bookquote">``So... like I was saying... if you want to learn some defense, then we need to work out how were going to do it, how often were going to meet and where were going to -''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>interrupted the girl with the long plait down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) back, looking at Harry, <div class="bookquote">``that you can produce a Patronus?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry slightly defensively.
<div class="bookquote">``A corporeal Patronus?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>The phrase stirred something in Harrys memory.
<div class="bookquote">``Er - you dont know Madam Bones, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked.
The girl smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)s my auntie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Im Susan Bones. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) told me about your hearing. So - is it really
true? You make a stag Patronus?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Blimey, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan</b></font>)</div>said Lee, looking deeply impressed. <div class="bookquote">``I never knew that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mum told Ron not to spread it around,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, grinning at Harry. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) said you got enough
attention as it was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>)s not wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>mumbled Harry, and a couple of people laughed.
The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) seat.
<div class="bookquote">``And did you kill a Basilisk with that sword in Dumbledores office?''  (<font color='red'><b>Terry Boot</b></font>)</div>demanded Terry Boot. <div class="bookquote">``Thats what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Er - yeah, I did, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled; the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and Lavender
Brown said <div class="bookquote">``Wow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavender Brown</b></font>)</div>softly. Harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
determinedly looking anywhere but at Cho.
<div class="bookquote">``And in our first year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville to the group at large, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) saved that Sorcerous Stone -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sorcerers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>hissed Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, that - from You-Know-Who,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>finished Neville.
Hannah Abbotts eyes were as round as Galleons.
<div class="bookquote">``And thats not to mention,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cho/Cho Chang/Chang</b></font>)</div>said Cho -LRB-Harrys eyes snapped across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), smiling; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach did another somersault-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``all the tasks he (<font color='blue'><b>Sorcerer</b></font>) had to get through in the
Triwizard Tournament last year - getting past dragons and merpeople and Acromantula and
things...''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. Harrys insides were squirming.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was trying to arrange his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not look too pleased with himself. The fact that
Cho had just praised him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) made it much, much harder for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) to say the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) had sworn to
himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) would tell them.
<div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) said, and everyone fell silent at once, <div class="bookquote">'' I... I dont want to sound like Im trying to be
modest or anything, but... I had a lot of help with all that stuff...''
 (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not with the dragon, you didnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael Corner/Michael</b></font>)</div>said Michael Corner at once. <div class="bookquote">``That was a seriously cool bit of
flying...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, well -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree.
<div class="bookquote">``And nobody helped you get rid of those Dementors this summer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan Bones</b></font>)</div>said Susan Bones.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``no, okay, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point Im trying to make is -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Zacharias Smith.
<div class="bookquote">``Heres an idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, <div class="bookquote">``why dont you shut your mouth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Perhaps the word weasel had affected Ron particularly strongly. In any case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was now
looking at Zacharias as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zacharias</b></font>) would like nothing better than to thump him (<font color='blue'><b>Zacharias</b></font>). Zacharias
flushed.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, weve all turned up to learn from him (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) and now he (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>)s telling us he (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) cant really do any of it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Zacharias</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Thats not what he (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>snarled Fred.
<div class="bookquote">``Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>enquired George, pulling a long and lethal looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonkos bags.
<div class="bookquote">``Or any part of your body, really, were not fussy where we stick this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione hastily, <div class="bookquote">``moving on... the point is, are we agreed we want to take
lessons from Harry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Zacharias</b></font>) arms and said nothing, though
perhaps this was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Zacharias</b></font>) was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in Freds hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled. <div class="bookquote">``Well, then, the
next question is how often we do it. I really dont think theres any point in meeting less than
once a week -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hang on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina, <div class="bookquote">``we need to make sure this doesnt clash with our Quidditch practice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cho/Cho Chang/Chang</b></font>)</div>said Cho, <div class="bookquote">``nor with ours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cho/Cho Chang/Chang</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nor ours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zacharias Smith/Zacharias/Smith</b></font>)</div>added Zacharias Smith.
<div class="bookquote">``Im sure we can find a night that suits everyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>aid Hermione, slightly impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``but you
know, this is rather important, were talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemorts Death Eaters -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well said!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>barked Ernie Macmillan, who Harry had been expecting to speak long before this.
<div class="bookquote">``Personally I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else well do
this year, even with our OWLs coming up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry <div class="bookquote">``Surely not!''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>When nobody
spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I, personally am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless
teacher on us at this critical period. Obviously, they are in denial about the return of You-Know-
Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells -''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We think the reason Umbridge doesnt want us trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said
Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s got some... some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in
the school as a kind of private army. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)d mobilize us against the Ministry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna Lovegood, who piped up,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) own private army.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>)s got an army of Heliopaths,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>said Luna so lemnly.
<div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) hasnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>snapped Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) has,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>said Luna.
<div class="bookquote">``What are Heliopaths?''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>asked Neville, looking blank.
<div class="bookquote">``Theyre spirits of fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>said Luna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) protuberant eyes widening so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked madder than ever, <div class="bookquote">``great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of -''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They dont exist, Neville,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Hermione tartly.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, they do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>said Luna angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``Im sorry, but wheres the proof of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>snapped Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``There are plenty of eye-witness accounts. Just because youre so narrow-minded you need to
have everything shoved under your nose before you -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hem, hem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny, in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people
looked around in alarm and then laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Werent we trying to decide how often were going to meet and have defense lessons?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione at once, <div class="bookquote">``yes, we were, youre right, Ginny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, once a week sounds cool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan</b></font>)</div>said Lee Jordan.
<div class="bookquote">``As long as -''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>began Angelina.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a tense voice. <div class="bookquote">``Well, the other thing
to decide is where were going to meet...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent.
<div class="bookquote">``Library?''  (<font color='red'><b>Katie/Katie Bell/Bell</b></font>)</div>suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.
<div class="bookquote">``I cant see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe an unused classroom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean/Dean Thomas/Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Dean.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, <div class="bookquote">``McGonagall might let us have hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) did when Harry was practicing for the Triwizard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time. For all
that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had the distinct
feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.
<div class="bookquote">``Right, well, well try to find somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Well send a message round to
everybody when weve got a time and a place for the first meeting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) rummaged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was steeling herself to say something.
<div class="bookquote">``I - I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also
think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) took a deep breath, <div class="bookquote">``that we all ought to agree not to shout about what were doing. So if you sign, youre agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what were up to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) signature, but Harry noticed at once
that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list.
<div class="bookquote">``Er...''  (<font color='red'><b>Zacharias Smith/Zacharias/Smith</b></font>)</div>said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``well... Im sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing, too. Hermione raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyebrows at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ernie</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I - well, we are prefects,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Macmillan/Macmillan</b></font>)</div>Ernie burst out. <div class="bookquote">``And if this list was found... well, I mean to say...
you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You just said this group was the most important thing youd do this year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I - yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Macmillan/Macmillan</b></font>)</div>said Ernie, <div class="bookquote">``yes, I do believe that, it  s just -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Macmillan/Macmillan</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ernie, do you really think Id leave that list lying around?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Macmillan/Macmillan</b></font>)</div>said Hermione testily.
<div class="bookquote">``No. No, of course not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Macmillan/Macmillan</b></font>)</div>said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious. <div class="bookquote">``I - yes, of course Ill sign.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div>Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Chos friend give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) a rather
reproachful look before adding her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) own name. When the last person - Zacharias - had signed,
Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag. There was an odd
feeling in the group now. It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, times ticking on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred briskly, getting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``George, Lee and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, well be seeing you all later.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave, too.
Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag before leaving, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) long dark
curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) friend stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), arms folded,
clicking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). As her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) friend ushered her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I think that went quite well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione happily, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), Harry and Ron walked out of
the Hogs Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later. Harry and Ron were clutching their
bottles of Butterbeer.
<div class="bookquote">``That Zacharias blokes a wart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith, just
discernible in the distance.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont like him (<font color='blue'><b>Zacharias</b></font>) much, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>admitted Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Zacharias</b></font>) overheard me talking to Ernie and
Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernie</b></font>) seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say?
But the more people the better really - I mean, Michael Corner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Corner</b></font>) friends wouldnt have
come if he (<font color='blue'><b>Corner</b></font>) hadnt been going out with Ginny -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) Butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed
Butterbeer down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) front.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Corner</b></font>)s WHAT?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>spluttered Ron, outraged, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ears now resembling curls of raw beef. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)s
going out with - my sisters going - what dyou mean, Michael Corner?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, thats why he (<font color='blue'><b>Corner</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Corner</b></font>) friends came, I think - well, theyre obviously interested in learning
defense, but if Ginny hadnt told Michael what was going on -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When did this - when did she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They met at the Yule Ball and got together at the end of last year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High Street and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) paused outside Scrivenshafts Quill Shop, where
there was a handsome display of pheasant feather quills in the window. <div class="bookquote">``Hmm... I could do with
a new quill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Which one was Michael Corner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron demanded furiously.
<div class="bookquote">``The dark one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``I didnt like him (<font color='blue'><b>Corner</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron at once.
<div class="bookquote">``Big surprise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) breath.
<div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots, <div class="bookquote">``I thought Ginny
fancied Harry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) rather pityingly and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) gave up on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) months ago. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) doesnt like you, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) added kindly to Harry while she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) examined a long black and gold quill.
Harry, whose head was still full of Chos parting wave, did not find this subject quite as
interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering with indignation, but it did bring something
home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) that until now he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had not really registered.
<div class="bookquote">``So thats why she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) talks now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) asked Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) never used to talk in front of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think Ill have this one...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts, with Ron still
breathing down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) neck.
<div class="bookquote">``Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said severely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) turned and trod on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet, <div class="bookquote">``this is exactly why Ginny hasnt told
you she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)s seeing Michael, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) knew youd take it badly. So dont harp on about it, for heavens
sake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean? Whos taking anything badly? Im not going to harp on about anything...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron continued to chunter under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) breath all the way down the street.
Hermione rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was still muttering
imprecations about Michael Corner, <div class="bookquote">``And talking about Michael and Ginny... what about Cho
and you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Michael Corner/Michael</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly.
It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); a burning sensation that was
causing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face to smart in the cold -had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) been that obvious?
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, smiling slightly, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) just couldnt keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) eyes off you, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was.
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four
Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done all term. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Ron spent much
of Sunday catching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called
fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the
common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the
edge of the lake. Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) work, brought more wool
outside with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and bewitched her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), producing more hats and scarves.
Knowing they were doing something to resist Umbridge and the Ministry, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was a key
part of the rebellion, gave Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kept reliving Saturdays
meeting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind: all those people, coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts...
and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done... and Cho praising
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) performance in the Triwizard Tournament - The knowledge that all those people did not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) up so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) least favorite classes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory, discussing Angelinas idea that they were to
work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that nights Quidditch practice, and not
until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room
that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people.
A large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor noticeboard; so large it covered everything else
on it - the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from
Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training timetable, the offers to barter certain Chocolate Frog
Cards for others, the Weasleys latest advertisement for testers, the dates of the Hogsmeade
weekends and the lost and found notices. The new sign was printed in large black letters and
there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature.
BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS
All student organizations, societies, teams, groups and clubs are henceforth disbanded.
An organization, society, team, group or club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or
more students.
Permission to re-form may be sought from the High Inquisitor -LRB-Professor Umbridge-RRB-.
No student organization, society, team, group or club may exist without the knowledge and
approval of the High Inquisitor.
Any student found to have formed, or to belong to, an organization, society, team, group or club
that has not been approved by the High Inquisitor will be expelled.
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-four.
Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge, High Inquisitor
Harry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some anxious-looking second-years.
<div class="bookquote">``Does this mean theyre going to shut down the Gobstones Club?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>one of them asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) friend.
<div class="bookquote">``I reckon youll be okay with Gobstones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron said darkly, making the second-year jump. <div class="bookquote">``I dont think were going to be as lucky, though, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) asked Harry as the second-years hurried away.
Harry was reading the notice through again. The happiness that had filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) since Saturday
was gone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides were pulsing with rage.
<div class="bookquote">``This isnt a coincidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands forming fists. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) knows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) cant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron at once.
<div class="bookquote">``There were people listening in that pub. And lets face it, we dont know how many of the people who turned up we can trust... any of them could have run off and told Umbridge...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had thought they believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), thought they even admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)...
<div class="bookquote">``Zacharias Smith!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Ron at once, punching a fist into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Or - I thought that Michael
Corner had a really shifty look, too -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if Hermiones seen this yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said, looking round at the door to the girls
dormitories.
<div class="bookquote">``Lets go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bounded forwards, pulled open the door and set off up the
spiral staircase.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was on the sixth stair when there was a loud, wailing, klaxon-like sound and the steps melted
together to make a long, smooth stone slid. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back at Harrys feet.
<div class="bookquote">``Er - I dont think were allowed in the girls dormitories,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, pulling Ron to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet and trying not to laugh.
Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.
<div class="bookquote">``Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry
and Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who was still rather disheveled. <div class="bookquote">'' I didnt realize that would happen. Its not
fair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) added to Harry, as the girls headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. <div class="bookquote">``Hermiones allowed in our dormitory, how come were not allowed -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, its an old-fashioned rule,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of
them and was now getting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet, <div class="bookquote">``but it says in Hogwarts A History, that the founders
thought boys were less trustworthy than girls. Anyway, why were you trying to get in there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To see you - look at this!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) over to the noticeboard.
Hermiones eyes slid rapidly down the notice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) expression became stony.
<div class="bookquote">``Someone must have blabbed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron said angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``They cant have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a low voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Youre so naive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, <div class="bookquote">``you think just because youre all honorable and trustworthy -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, they cant have done, because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said
Hermione grimly. <div class="bookquote">``Believe me, if anyones run off and told Umbridge, well know exactly who
they are and they will really regret it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whatll happen to them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron eagerly.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, put it this way''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``itll make Eloise Midgeons acne look like a couple of
cute freckles. Come on, lets get down to breakfast and see what the others think... I wonder
whether this has been put up in all the houses?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>It was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Umbridges sign had not only
appeared in Gryffindor Tower. There was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra
measure of movement in the Hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what
they had read. Harry, Ron and Hermione had barely taken their seats when Neville, Dean, Fred,
George and Ginny descended upon them.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you see it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dyou reckon she (<font color='blue'><b>Eloise</b></font>) knows?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are we going to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>They were all looking at Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near
them.
<div class="bookquote">``Were going to do it anyway of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``Knew youd say that''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, beaming and thumping Harry on the arm.
<div class="bookquote">``The prefects as well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione coolly.
<div class="bookquote">``Here come Ernie and Hannah Abbott,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``And those
Ravenclaw blokes and Smith... and no one looks very spotty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione looked alarmed.
<div class="bookquote">``Nevermind spots, the idiots cant come over here now, itll look really suspicious - sit down!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table.
<div class="bookquote">``Later! Well - talk - to - you - later!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ill tell Michael,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) bench, <div class="bookquote">``the fool, honestly...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) hurried off towards the Ravenclaw table; Harry watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) go. Cho was sitting not far
away, talking to the curly-haired friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) had brought along to the Hogs Head. Would
Umbridges notice scare her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) off meeting them again?
But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the Great Hall for
History of Magic.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry! Ron!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>It was Angelina and she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) was hurrying towards them looking perfectly desperate.
<div class="bookquote">``Its okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quietly, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) was near enough to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Were still going to -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You realize she (<font color='blue'><b>Ravenclaw</b></font>)s including Quidditch in this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>Angelina said over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We have to go and ask
permission to re-form the Gryffindor team!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``No way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, appalled.
<div class="bookquote">``You read the sign, it mentions teams too! So listen, Harry... I am saying this for the last time...
please, please dont lose your temper with Umbridge again or she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) might not let us play any
more!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay,okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, for Angelina looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) was on the verge of tears. <div class="bookquote">``Dont
worry, Ill behave myself...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron grimly, as they set off for Binnss lesson. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
hasnt inspected Binns yet... bet you anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s there...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was Professor Binns, floating an
inch or so above his (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) chair as usual and preparing to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) monotonous drone on giant
wars. Harry did not even attempt to follow what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was saying today; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doodled idly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
parchment ignoring Hermiones frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in
the ribs made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) look up angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pointed at the window. Harry looked round. Hedwig was perched on the narrow window
ledge, gazing through the thick glass at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), a letter tied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) leg. Harry could not understand
it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadnt she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) delivered the letter then, as usual? Many
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other, too.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Ive always loved that owl, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s so beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced round at Professor Binns who continued to read his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) notes, serenely unaware that the
classs attention was even less focused upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) than usual. Harry slipped quietly off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair,
crouched down and hurried along the row to the window, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slid the catch and opened it
very slowly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had expected Hedwig to hold out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) leg so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could remove the letter and then fly off to
the Owlery but the moment the window was open wide enough she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) hopped inside, hooting
dolefully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, crouched low again
and sped back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) seat with Hedwig on his (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) seat, transferred Hedwig
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) lap and made to remove the letter tied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) leg.
Only then did he (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) realize that Hedwigs feathers were oddly ruffled; some were bent the wrong
way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) was holding one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) wings at an odd angle.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s hurt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry whispered, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head low over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>). Hermione and Ron leaned in
closer; Hermione even put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) quill. <div class="bookquote">``Look - theres something wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wing -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)</div>Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) gave a little jump, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)
feathers on end as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) was inflating herself, and gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reproachfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Professor Binns,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Im not
feeling well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Binns raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) notes, looking amazed, as always, to find the room in
front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) full of people.
<div class="bookquote">``Not feeling well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) repeated hazily.
<div class="bookquote">``Not at all well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry firmly getting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet with Hedwig concealed behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``I
think I need to go to the hospital wing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed. <div class="bookquote">``Yes... yes, hospital wing... well,
off you go, then, Perkins...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Once outside the room, Harry returned Hedwig to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder and hurried off up the corridor,
pausing to think only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was out of sight of Binnss door. His (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) first choice of somebody to
cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>) had no idea where Hagrid was his (<font color='blue'><b>Binns</b></font>)
only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) would help.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. There was no sign of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) anywhere
near Hagrids cabin; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) was not teaching, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) was probably in the staff room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) set off
downstairs, Hedwig hooting feebly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) swayed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) shoulder.
Two stone gargoyles flanked the staff-room door. As Harry approached, one of them croaked,
<div class="bookquote">``You should be in class, Sonny Jim.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is urgent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry curtly.
<div class="bookquote">``Ooooh, urgent, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gargoyle</b></font>)</div>said the other gargoyle in a high-pitched voice. <div class="bookquote">``Well, thats put us in our
place, hasnt it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry knocked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard footsteps, then the door opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found himself face to face with
Professor McGonagall.
<div class="bookquote">``You havent been given another detention!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said at once, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) square spectacles flashing
alarmingly.
<div class="bookquote">``No, Professor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry hastily.
<div class="bookquote">``Well then, why are you out of class?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its urgent, apparently,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gargoyle</b></font>)</div>said the second gargoyle snidely.
<div class="bookquote">``Im looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry explained. <div class="bookquote">``Its my owl, she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)s injured.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Injured owl, did you say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagalls shoulder, smoking a pipe and
holding a copy of the Daily Prophet.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) turned up after the other post
owls and her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) wings all funny, look -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)</div>Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) pipe firmly between her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) teeth and took Hedwig from Harry
while Professor McGonagall watched.
<div class="bookquote">``Hmm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) pipe waggling slightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) talked. <div class="bookquote">``Looks like
somethings attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>). Cant think what would have done it, though. Thestrals will sometimes
go for birds, of course, but Hagrids got the Hogwarts Thestrals well-trained not to touch owls.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry neither knew nor cared what Thestrals were; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) just wanted to know that Hedwig was
going to be all right. Professor McGonagall, however, looked sharply at Harry and said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you
know how far this owls traveled, Potter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Er,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``From London, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) eyes briefly and knew, by the way her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) eyebrows had joined in the middle, that she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
understood London to mean number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) robes and screwed it into her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
eye, to examine Hedwigs wing closely. <div class="bookquote">``I should be able to sort this out if you leave her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) with
me, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) shouldnt be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Er - right - thanks''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, just as the bell rang for break.
<div class="bookquote">``No problem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back into the staff room.
<div class="bookquote">``Just a moment, Wilhelmina!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall. <div class="bookquote">``Potters letter!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to Hedwigs leg. Professor
Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared into the staff room carrying Hedwig, who
was staring at Harry as though unable to believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) away like this. Feeling
slightly guilty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to go, but Professor McGonagall called him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) back.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Professor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming from both directions.
<div class="bookquote">``Bear in mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said quickly and quietly, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) eyes on the scroll in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``that channels of
communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched, wont you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Professor McGonagall gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) a curt nod and retreated into the staff room, leaving Harry to be
swept out into the courtyard with the crowd. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spotted Ron and Hermione already standing in a
sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up against the wind. Harry slit open the scroll as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hurried towards them and found five words in Siriuss handwriting:
Today, same time, same place.
<div class="bookquote">``Is Hedwig okay?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was within earshot.
<div class="bookquote">``Where did you take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``To Grubbly-Plank,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``And I met McGonagall... listen...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told them what Professor McGonagall had said. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) surprise, neither of the others
looked shocked. On the contrary, they exchanged significant looks.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, looking from Ron to Hermione and back again.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I was just saying to Ron... what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig? I mean, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)s
never been hurt on a flight before, has she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whos the letter from, anyway?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Ron, taking the note from Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Snuffles''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quietly.
<div class="bookquote">''Same time, same place? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mean the fire in the common room?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Obviously,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, also reading the note. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked uneasy. <div class="bookquote">``I just hope nobody else
has read this...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it was still sealed and everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, trying to convince himself as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``And nobody would understand what it meant if they didnt know where wed spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
before, would they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione anxiously, hitching h er bag back over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shoulder as the bell
rang again, <div class="bookquote">``it wouldnt be exactly difficult to re-seal the scroll by magic... and if anyones
watching the Floo Network... but I dont really see how we can warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) not to come
without that being intercepted, too!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all three of them lost in thought,
but as they reached the bottom of the steps they were recalled to themselves by the voice of
Draco Malfoy who was standing just outside Snapes classroom door, waving around an official looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear
every word.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing
straightaway, I went to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) first thing this morning. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I
mean, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) knows my father really well, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)s always popping in and out of the Ministry... itll be
interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, wont it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont rise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron, who were both watching
Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched. <div class="bookquote">``Its what he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) wants.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) voice a little more, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) grey eyes glittering malevolently in
Harry and Rons direction, <div class="bookquote">``if its a question of influence with the Ministry, I dont think theyve
got much chance... from what my father says, theyve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur
Weasley for years... and as for Potter... my father says its a matter of time before the Ministry
has him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) carted off to St. Mungos... apparently theyve got a special ward for people whose
brains have been addled by magic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Malfoy made a grotesque face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) mouth sagging open and his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) eyes rolling. Crabbe and Goyle
gave their usual grunts of laughter; Pansy Parkinson shrieked with glee.
Something collided hard with Harrys shoulder, knocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sideways. A split second later he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
realized that Neville had just charged past him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>), heading straight for Malfoy.
<div class="bookquote">``Neville, no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Nevilles robes; Neville struggled frantically, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) fists
flailing, trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked.
<div class="bookquote">``Help me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an arm around Nevilles neck and dragging him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
backwards, away from the Slytherins. Crabbe and Goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped
in front of Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron seized Nevilles arms, and together he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and Harry
succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line. Nevilles face was scarlet; the
pressure Harry was exerting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quite incomprehensible, but odd words
spluttered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``Not... funny... dont... Mungos... show... him (<font color='blue'><b>Mungo</b></font>)...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>The dungeon door opened. Snape appeared there. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to
the point where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville.
<div class="bookquote">``Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) cold, sneering voice. <div class="bookquote">``Ten points from Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, Potter, or it will be detention. Inside, all of you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry let go of Neville, who stood panting and glaring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I had to stop you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry gasped, picking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag. <div class="bookquote">``Crabbe and Goyle wouldve torn you
apart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville said nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) merely snatched up his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) own bag and stalked off into the dungeon.
<div class="bookquote">``What in the name of Merlin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron slowly, as they followed Neville, <div class="bookquote">``was that about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Harry did not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St. Mungos
because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to Neville, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had sworn to
Dumbledore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) would not tell anyone Nevilles secret. Even Neville did not know Harry
knew.
Harry, Ron and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class, pulled out parchment,
quills and their copies of One Thousand Magical Herb s and Fungi. The class around them was
whispering about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dungeon door with an
echoing bang, everybody immediately fell silent.
<div class="bookquote">``You will notice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) low, sneering voice, <div class="bookquote">``that we have a guest with us today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) gestured towards the dim corner of the dungeon and Harry saw Professor Umbridge sitting
there, clipboard on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) knee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyebrows raised.
Snape and Umbridge, the two teachers he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hated most. It was hard to decide which one he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wanted
to triumph over the other.
<div class="bookquote">``We are continuing with our Strengthening Solution today. You will find your mixtures as you
left them last lesson; if correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend -
instructions -''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand again <div class="bookquote">''- on the board. Carry on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) corner. Harry was
very interested in hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) question Snape; so interested, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was becoming careless with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) potion again.
<div class="bookquote">``Salamander blood, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione moaned, grabbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrist to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) adding the
wrong ingredient for the third time, <div class="bookquote">``not pomegranate juice!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner.
Umbridge had just got to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Ha,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said softly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) strode between two lines of desks
towards Snape, who was bending over Dean Thomass cauldron.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, the class seem fairly advanced for their level,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said briskly to Snapes back. <div class="bookquote">``Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I
think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Now... how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) asked, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) quill poised over her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
clipboard.
<div class="bookquote">``Fourteen years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape replied. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) expression was unfathomable. Harry, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closely,
added a few drops to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange.
<div class="bookquote">``You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge
asked Snape.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``But you were unsuccessful?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>Snapes lip curled.
<div class="bookquote">``Obviously''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge scribbled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard.
<div class="bookquote">``And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post since you first
joined the school, I believe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape quietly, barely moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) looked very angry.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>asked
Umbridge.
<div class="bookquote">``I suggest you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape jerkily.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, with a sweet smile.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose this is relevant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) black eyes narrowed.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge, <div class="bookquote">``yes, the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of
teachers - er - backgrounds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) about the lessons.
Snape looked round at Harry and their eyes met for a second. Harry hastily dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gaze to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) potion, which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber.
<div class="bookquote">``No marks again, then, Potter''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape maliciously, emptying Harrys cauldron with a wave
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand. <div class="bookquote">``You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion, indicating
how and why you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry furiously. Snape had already given them homework and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had Quidditch
practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights. It did not seem
possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had awoken that morning feeling very happy. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) felt now was a fervent
desire for this day to end.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe Ill skive off Divination,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) said glumly, as they stood in the courtyard after lunch, the
wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats. <div class="bookquote">``Ill pretend to be ill and do Snapes essay
instead, then I wont have to stay up half the night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You cant skive off Divination,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione severely.
<div class="bookquote">``Hark whos talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate Trelawney!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron indignantly.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont hate her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione loftily. <div class="bookquote">``I just think she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)s an absolutely appalling teacher and a
real old fraud. But Harrys already missed History of Magic and I dont think he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) ought to miss
anything else today!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry took his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seat in the hot,
overperfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom, feeling angry at everybody. Professor
Trelawney was yet again handing out copies of The Dream Oracle. Harry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d surely be
much better employed doing Snapes punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning
in a lot of made-up dreams.
It seemed, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was not the only person in Divination who was in a temper.
Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron
and swept away, her (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>) lips pursed; she (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>) threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean,
narrowly avoiding Seamuss head, and thrust the final one into Nevilles chest with such force
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) slipped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) pouffe.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, carry on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney loudly, her (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>) voice high-pitched and somewhat
hysterical, <div class="bookquote">``you know what to do! Or am I such a sub-standard teacher that you have never
learned how to open a book?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Trelawney/Sibyll/Sibyll Trelawney</b></font>)</div>The class stared perplexedly at her (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>), then at each other. Harry, however, thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew what
was the matter. As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teachers chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>)
magnified eyes full of angry tears, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) head closer to Rons and muttered, <div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)s got the results of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) inspection back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Professor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil/Patil</b></font>)</div>said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Patil</b></font>) and Lavender had always rather admired
Professor Trelawney-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Professor, is there anything - er - wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wrong!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly not! I have
been insulted, certainly... insinuations have been made against me... unfounded accusations
leveled... but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Patil</b></font>) took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati, angry tears spilling from
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) glasses.
<div class="bookquote">``I say nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) choked, <div class="bookquote">``of sixteen years of devoted service... it has passed, apparently,
unnoticed... but I shall not be insulted, no, I shall not!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, Professor, whos insulting you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil/Patil</b></font>)</div>asked Parvati timidly.
<div class="bookquote">``The Establishment!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney, in a deep, dramatic, wavering voice. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, those
with eyes too clouded by the mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know... of course, we Seers
have always been feared, always persecuted... it is - alas -our fate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) gulped, dabbed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) wet cheeks with the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) shawl, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) pulled a small
embroidered handkerchief from her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) sleeve, and blew her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) nose very hard with a sound like Peeves
blowing a raspberry.
Ron sniggered. Lavender shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) a disgusted look.
<div class="bookquote">``Professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil/Patil</b></font>)</div>said Parvati, <div class="bookquote">``do you mean... is it something Professor Umbridge -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil/Patil</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do not speak to me about that woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>cried Professor Trelawney, leaping to her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) feet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>)
beads rattling and her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) spectacles flashing. <div class="bookquote">``Kindly continue with your work!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still leaking from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>)
glasses, muttering what sounded like threats under her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) breath.
<div class="bookquote">''... may well choose to leave... the indignity of it... on probation... we shall see... how she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>)
dares...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You and Umbridge have got something in common,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry told Hermione quietly when they
met again in Defense Against the Dark Arts. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) obviously reckons Trelawneys an old fraud,
too... looks like she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s put her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) on probation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>Umbridge entered the room as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spoke, wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) black velvet bow and an expression of
great smugness.
<div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, class.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they chanted dully.
<div class="bookquote">``Wands away, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But there was no answering flurry of movement this time; nobody had bothered to take out their
wands.
<div class="bookquote">``Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter, entitled
Case for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack. There will be -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- no need to talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry, Ron and Hermione said together, under their breaths.
<div class="bookquote">``No Quidditch practice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry, Ron and Hermione entered
the common room after dinner that night.
<div class="bookquote">``But I kept my temper!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, horrified. <div class="bookquote">``I didnt say anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), Angelina, I swear, I -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina miserably. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) just said she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) needed a bit of time to consider.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Consider what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron angrily. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>)s given the Slytherins permission, why not us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor
Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) would not want to
relinquish that weapon over them too soon.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``look on the bright side - at least now youll have time to do Snapes
essay!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats a bright side, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>snapped Harry, while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``No
Quidditch practice, and extra Potions?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Potions essay reluctantly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag and set to
work. It was very hard to concentrate; even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew Sirius was not due in the fire until
much later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case. There was
also an incredible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared finally to have
perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a
cheering and whooping crowd.
First, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would vomit
spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would force down the
purple end of the chew, at which the vomiting would immediately cease. Lee Jordan, who was
assisting the demonstration, was lazily Vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same
Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harrys potions.
What with the regular sounds of retching, cheering and the sound of Fred and George taking
advance orders from the crowd, Harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the
correct method for Strengthening Solution. Hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and the
sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and Georges bucket were punctuated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) loud and
disapproving sniffs, which Harry found, if anything, more distracting.
<div class="bookquote">``Just go and stop them, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said irritably, after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered
griffin claw for the fourth time.
<div class="bookquote">``I cant, theyre not technically doing anything wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione through gritted teeth.
<div class="bookquote">``Theyre quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and I cant find a rule that says the other idiots arent entitled to buy them, not unless theyre proven to be dangerous in some way and it doesnt look as though they are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), Harry and Ron watched George projectile-vomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the
chew and straighten up, beaming with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms wide to protracted applause.
<div class="bookquote">``You know, I dont get why Fred and George only got three OWLs each,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, watching
as Fred, George and Lee collected gold from the eager crowd. <div class="bookquote">``They really know their stuff.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they only know flashy stuff thats of no real use to anyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione disparagingly.
<div class="bookquote">``No real use?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron in a strained voice. <div class="bookquote">``Hermione, theyve made about twenty-six Galleons
already.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasley twins dispersed, then Fred, Lee and
George sat up counting their takings even longer, so it was well past midnight when Harry, Ron
and Hermione finally had the common room to themselves. At long last, Fred had closed the
doorway to the boys dormitories behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), rattling his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) box of Galleons ostentatiously so that
Hermione scowled. Harry, who was making very little progress with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Potions essay, decided
to give it up for the night. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) books away, Ron, who was dozing lightly in an
armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, and looked blearily into the fire.
<div class="bookquote">``Sirius!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said.
Harry whipped round. Siriuss untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, grinning.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>chorused Harry, Ron and Hermione, all three kneeling down on the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face close
to Siriuss.
<div class="bookquote">``Howre things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``Not that good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) singeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
whiskers. <div class="bookquote">``The Ministrys forced through another decree, which means were not allowed to have Quidditch teams -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius.
There was a short pause.
<div class="bookquote">``How did you know about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, grinning still more
broadly. <div class="bookquote">``The Hogs Head, I ask you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione defensively. <div class="bookquote">``Thats always
packed with people -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Which means youd have been harder to overhear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``Youve got a lot to learn,
Hermione.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who overheard us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``Mundungus, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, and when they all looked puzzled he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) was the
witch under the veil.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That was Mundungus?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said, stunned. <div class="bookquote">``What was he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) doing in the Hogs Head?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) was doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Keeping an eye on you, of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im still being followed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>asked Harry angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, <div class="bookquote">``and just as well, isnt it, if the first thing youre going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal defense group.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) looked neither angry nor worried. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was looking at Harry with distinct
pride.
<div class="bookquote">``Why was Dung hiding from us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Ron, sounding disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``Wedve liked tove seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) was banned from the Hogs Head twenty years ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, <div class="bookquote">``and that barmans got a
long memory. We lost Moodys spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dungs

 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, sounding apprehensive.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret Defense Against the

there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be
worrying about that right now. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) also''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Siriuss eyes turned to the other two-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``advises Harry

would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted youd all have been in real
trouble, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cant say it for herself because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)s on duty tonight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On duty doing what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``So its fallen to me to be the messenger
and make sure you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) I passed it all on, because I dont think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) trusts me to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>There was another pause in which Crookshanks, mewing, attempted to paw Siriuss head, and
Ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug.
<div class="bookquote">``So, you want me to say Im not going to take part in the Defense group?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) muttered finally.
<div class="bookquote">``Me? Certainly not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, looking surprised. <div class="bookquote">``I think its an excellent idea!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart lifting.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``Dyou think your father and I wouldve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But - last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Last year, all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you, Harry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``This year, we know theres someone outside Hogwarts whod like to kill us all, so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And if we do get expelled?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked, a quizzical look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Hermione, this whole thing was your idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I know it was. I just wondered what Sirius thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, shrugging.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry and Ron enthusiastically.
<div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, <div class="bookquote">``how are you organizing this group? Where are you meeting?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, thats a bit of a problem now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Dunno where were going to be able to go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How about the Shrieking Shack?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>suggested Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, thats an idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron excitedly, but Hermione made a skeptical noise and all three of
them looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), Siriuss head turning in the flames.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Sirius, its just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you
were at school,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you
could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if youd wanted to. But there are
twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldnt need so much an Invisibility
Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fair point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, looking slightly crestfallen. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Im sure youll come up with
somewhere. There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the
fourth floor, you might have enough space to practice jinxes in there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fred and George told me its blocked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Caved in or something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh...''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, frowning. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Ill have a think and get back to -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) broke off. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) face was suddenly tense, alarmed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) turned sideways, apparently looking into
the solid brick wall of the fireplace.
<div class="bookquote">``Sirius?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry anxiously.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and
Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet, still staring at the fire.
A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a
stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings.
The three of them ran for it. At the door of the boys dormitory Harry looked back. Umbridges
hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) knew exactly
where Siriuss hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Dumbledores Army
<div class="bookquote">``Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. Theres no other explanation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Army</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said, outraged.
<div class="bookquote">``Im almost certain of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione grimly. <div class="bookquote">``Watch your frog, its escaping.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of
the table - <div class="bookquote">``Accio!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>- and it zoomed gloomily back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand.
Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat; there was generally
so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with
the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain
clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron and Hermiones whispered
discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.
<div class="bookquote">``Ive been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it
seemed such a stupid lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, once your letter had been read it would
have been quite clear you werent ordering them, so you wouldnt have been in trouble at all - its a bit of a feeble joke, isnt it? But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it - tip off Filch, let him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) or else demand to see it - I dont think Filch would object, whens he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ever stuck up for a students rights? Harry, youre squashing your frog.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry looked down; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was indeed squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
replaced it hastily upon the desk.
<div class="bookquote">``It was a very, very close call last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``I just wonder if Umbridge knows how
close it was. Silencio.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The bullfrog on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was practicing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and
glared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) reproachfully.
<div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)d caught Snuffles -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry finished the sentence for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">''- He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d probably be back in Azkaban this morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand without really
concentrating; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a high-pitched whistle.
<div class="bookquote">``Silencio!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione hastily, pointing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand at Harrys frog, which deflated silently
before them. <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mustnt do it again, thats all. I just dont know how were going to let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) know. We cant send him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) an owl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)ll risk it again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s not stupid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) nearly got
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Silencio.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The large and ugly raven in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) let out a derisive caw.
<div class="bookquote">``Silencio. SILENCIO!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The raven cawed more loudly.
<div class="bookquote">``Its the way youre moving your wand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, watching Ron critically, <div class="bookquote">``you dont want to wave it, its more a sharp jab.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ravens are harder than frogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron through clenched teeth.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine, lets swap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, seizing Rons raven and replacing it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) own fat bullfrog.
<div class="bookquote">``Silencio!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The raven continued to open and close its sharp beak, but no sound came out.
<div class="bookquote">``Very good, Miss Granger!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Flitwicks squeaky little voice, making Harry, Ron
and Hermione all jump. <div class="bookquote">``Now, let me see you try, Mr. Weasley.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wha--? Oh - oh, right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, very flustered. <div class="bookquote">``Er - silencio!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) jabbed at the bullfrog so hard he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) poked it in the eye: the frog gave a deafening croak and
leapt off the desk.
It came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and Ron were given additional practice of the
Silencing Charm for homework.
They were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside. They found seats in
a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up
near the chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebodys head. They had
barely sat down when Angelina came struggling towards them through the groups of gossiping
students.
<div class="bookquote">``Ive got permission!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``To re-form the Quidditch team!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Excellent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron and Harry together.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina, beaming. <div class="bookquote">``I went to McGonagall and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) might have appealed to
Dumbledore. Anyway, Umbridge had to give in. Ha! So I want you down at the pitch at seven
oclock tonight, all right, because weve got to make up time. You realize were only three weeks away from our first match?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) squeezed away from them, narrowly dodged an ink pellet from Peeves, which hit a nearby
first-year instead, and vanished from sight.
Rons smile slipped slightly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked out of the window, which was now opaque with
hammering rain.
<div class="bookquote">``Hope this clears up. Whats up with you, Hermione?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>), too, was gazing at the window, but not as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) really saw it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) eyes were unfocused
and there was a frown on her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Just thinking...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) said, still frowning at the rain-washed window.
<div class="bookquote">``About Siri-- Snuffles?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``No... not exactly...''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione slowly. <div class="bookquote">``More... wondering... I suppose were doing the
right thing... I think... arent we?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Ron looked at each other.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, that clears that up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``It wouldve been really annoying if you hadnt explained
yourself properly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had only just realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was there.
<div class="bookquote">``I was just wondering,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) voice stronger now, <div class="bookquote">``whether were doing the right thing,
starting this Defense Against the Dark Arts group.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry and Ron together.
<div class="bookquote">``Hermione, it was your idea in the first place!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron indignantly.
<div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) fingers together. <div class="bookquote">``But after talking to Snuffles...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)s all for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, staring at the window again. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, thats what made me think maybe it
wasnt a good idea after all...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Peeves floated over them on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach, peashooter at the ready; automatically all three of them
lifted their bags to cover their heads until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had passed.
<div class="bookquote">``Lets get this straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry angrily, as t hey put their bags back on the floor, <div class="bookquote">``Sirius agrees with us, so you dont think we should do it any more?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Hermione looked tense and rather miserable. Now staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) own hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you
honestly trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) judgment?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry at once. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s always given us great advice!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katie/Katie Bell/Bell</b></font>)</div>An ink pellet whizzed past them, striking Katie Bell squarely in the ear. Hermione watched Katie
leap to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before Hermione
spoke again and it sounded as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was choosing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) words very carefully.
<div class="bookquote">``You dont think he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) has become... sort of... reckless... since he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s been cooped up in Grimmauld
Place? You dont think he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s... kind of... living through us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean, through us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry retorted.
<div class="bookquote">``I mean... well, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)d love to be forming secret Defense societies right under the nose of
someone from the Ministry... I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s really frustrated at how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) can do where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) is...
so I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s keen to kind of... egg us on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron looked utterly perplexed.
<div class="bookquote">``Sirius is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you do sound just like my mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Hermione bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lip and did not answer. The bell rang just as Peeves swooped down on Katie
and emptied an entire ink bottle over her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) head.
The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven oclock that evening, when
Harry and Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within
minutes, their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass. The sky was a deep, thundery grey
and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms, even if they knew the
respite was only temporary. They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their
own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying.
<div class="bookquote">''... but I bet she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)d know what wed done,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>Fred said out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``If only I
hadnt offered to sell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) some Puking Pastilles yesterday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We could try the Fever Fudge,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>George muttered, <div class="bookquote">``no ones seen that yet -''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does it work?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>enquired Ron hopefully, as the hammering of rain on the roof intensified and
wind howled around the building.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, <div class="bookquote">``your temperaturell go right up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you get these massive pus-filled boils, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``and we havent worked out how
to get rid of them yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cant see any boils,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, staring at the, twins.
<div class="bookquote">``No, well, you wouldnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred darkly, <div class="bookquote">``theyre not in a place we generally display to the
public.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right, everyone, listen up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina loudly, emerging from the Captains office. ``I
know its not ideal weather, but theres a chance well be playing Slytherin in conditions like this
so its a good idea to work out how were going to cope with them. Harry, didnt you do
something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that
storm?
``Hermione did it,'' said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses and said, ``Impervius!''
``I think we all ought to try that,'' said Angelina. ``If we could just keep the rain off our faces it
would really help visibility - all together, come on - Impervius! okay. Lets go.''
They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes, shouldered their brooms
and followed Angelina out of the changing rooms.
They squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch; visibility was still very
poor even with the Impervius Charm; light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping
the grounds.
``All right, on my whistle,'' shouted Angelina.
Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and shot upwards, the wind
pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slightly off course.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no idea how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was having enough
difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing; a minute into the practice it
almost unseated him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it. Unfortunately, Angelina
did not see this. In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) did not appear to be able to see anything; none of them had a clue
what the others were doing. The wind was picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the
swishing, pounding sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake.
Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) sodden and
disgruntled team back into the changing rooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of
time, though without any real conviction in her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) voice. Fred and George were looking particularly
annoyed; both were bandy-legged and winced with every movement. Harry could hear them
complaining in low voices as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) toweled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair dry.
``I think a few of mine have ruptured,'' said Fred in a hollow voice.
``Mine havent,'' said George, through clenched teeth, ``theyre throbbing like mad... feel bigger if anything.''
``OUCH!'' said Harry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pressed the towel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes screwed tight with pain. The scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead had
seared again, more painfully than it had in weeks.
``Whats up?'' said several voices.
Harry emerged from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) towel; the changing room was blurred because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not
wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could still tell that everyones face was turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Nothing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttered, ``I - poked myself in the eye, thats all.''
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as the rest of the team filed
back outside, muffled in their cloaks, their hats pulled low over their ears.
``What happened?'' said Ron, the moment Alicia had disappeared through the door. ``Was it your
scar?''
Harry nodded.
``But...'' looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) - he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
cant be near us now, can he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''
``No,'' Harry muttered, sinking on to a bench and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)s probably miles
away. It hurt because... he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)s... angry.''
Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken them
- yet knew at once that they were true. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) did not know how he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) knew it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) did; Voldemort,
wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was doing, was in a towering temper.
``Did you see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?'' said Ron, looking horrified. ``Did you... get a vision, or something?''
Harry sat quite still, staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, allowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) memory to relax in the
aftermath of the pain.
A confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices...
``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wants something done, and its not happening fast enough,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
Again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth, and yet was quite certain
they were true.
``But... how do you know?'' said Ron.
Harry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands, pressing down upon them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
palms. Little stars erupted in them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt Ron sit down on the bench beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and knew Ron
was staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).
``Is this what it was about last time?'' said Ron in a hushed voice. ``When your scar hurt in
Umbridges office? You-Know-Who was angry?''
Harry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head.
``What is it, then?''
Harry was thinking himself back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been looking into Umbridges face... his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar had
hurt... and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had had that odd feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach... a strange, leaping feeling... a happy
feeling... but of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not recognized it for what it was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been feeling so
miserable himself...
``Last time, it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was pleased,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``Really pleased. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thought... something
good was going to happen. And the night before we came back to Hogwarts...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought back
to the moment when his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar had hurt so badly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Rons bedroom in Grimmauld Place...
``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was furious.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked round at Ron, who was gaping at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).
``You could take over from Trelawney, mate,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said in an awed voice.
``Im not making prophecies,'' said Harry.
``No, you know what youre doing?'' Ron said, sounding both scared and impressed. ``Harry, youre reading You-Know-Whos mind!''
``No,'' said Harry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. ``Its more like... his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mood, I suppose. Im just getting flashes of what mood he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s in. Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said that when Voldemort was near me, or when he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was feeling hatred, I could tell. Well, now Im feeling it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s pleased, too...''
There was a pause. The wind and rain lashed at the building.
``Youve got to tell someone,'' said Ron.
``I told Sirius last time.''
``Well, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) about this time!''
``Cant, can I?'' said Harry grimly. ``Umbridge is watching the owls and the fires, remember?''
``Well then, Dumbledore.''
``Ive just told you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) already knows,'' said Harry shortly, getting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cloak off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) peg and swinging it around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Theres no point telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) again.''
Ron did up the fastening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own cloak, watching Harry thoughtfully.
``Dumbledored want to know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
Harry shrugged.
``Cmon... weve still got Silencing Charms to practice.<div class="bookquote">''
They hurried back through the dark grounds, sliding and stumbling up the muddy lawns, not
talking. Harry was thinking hard. What was it that Voldemort wanted done that was not
happening quickly enough?
'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s got other plans... plans he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can put into operation very quietly indeed... stuff he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can only
get by stealth... like a weapon. Something he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didnt have last time.''
Harry had not thought about those words in weeks; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been too absorbed in what was going
on at Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with Umbridge, the injustice of all the
Ministry interference... but now they came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wonder... Voldemorts
anger would make sense if he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was no nearer to laying hands on the weapon, whatever it was.
Had the Order thwarted him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>), stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) from seizing it? Where was it kept? Who had it now?
``Mimbulus mimbletonia,'' said Rons voice and Harry came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) senses just in time to
clamber through the portrait hole into the common room.
It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair
and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire. Harry was rather
grateful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was not around, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not much want to discuss his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar hurting and
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to go to Dumbledore, too. Ron kept throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) anxious glances, but Harry
pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Charms books and set to work on finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) essay, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was only
pretending to concentrate and by the time Ron said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was going up to bed, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had written
hardly anything.
Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of
scurvy-grass, lovage and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it.
These plants are most efficacious in the inflaming of the brain, and are therefore much used
in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness...
... Hermione said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in Grimmauld Place...
... most efficacious in the inflaming of the brain, and are therefore much used...
... the Daily Prophet would think his (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) brain was inflamed if they found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) knew what
Voldemort was feeling...
... therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts...
... confusing was the word, all right; why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) know what Voldemort was feeling? What was
this weird connection between them, which Dumbledore had never been able to explain
satisfactorily?
... where the wizard is desirous...
... how Harry would like to sleep...
... producing hot-headedness...
... it was warm and comfortable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) armchair before the fire, with the rain still beating heavily
on the windowpanes, Crookshanks purring, and the crackling of the flames...
The book slipped from Harrys slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head
rolled sideways...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was walking once more along a windowless corridor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) footsteps echoing in the silence. As
the door at the end of the passage loomed larger, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart beat fast with excitement... if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
only open it... enter beyond...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand... his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingertips were inches from it...
``Harry Potter, sir!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) awoke with a start. The candles had all been extinguished in the common room, but there was
something moving close by.
``Whozair?'' said Harry, sitting upright in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair. The fire was almost out, the room very dark.
``Dobby has your owl, sir!'' said a squeaky voice.
``Dobby?'' said Harry thickly, peering through the gloom towards the source of the voice.
Dobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on which Hermione had left half a dozen of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) knitted hats. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) large, pointed ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all
the hats Hermione had ever knitted; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was wearing one on top of the other, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head
seemed elongated by two or three feet, and on the very topmost bobble sat Hedwig, hooting
serenely and obviously cured.
``Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potters owl,'' said the elf squeakily, with a look of positive
adoration on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, ``Professor Grubbly-Plank says she (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) is all well now, sir.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sank into a
deep bow so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pencil-like nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and
Hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered on to the arm of Harrys chair.
``Thanks, Dobby!'' said Harry, stroking Hedwigs head and blinking hard, trying to rid himself of
the image of the door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dream... it had been very vivid. Surveying Dobby more closely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet
looked far too big for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body.
``Er... have you been taking all the clothes Hermiones been leaving out?''
``Oh, no, sir,'' said Dobby happily. ``Dobby has been taking some for Winky, too, sir.''
``Yeah, how is Winky?'' asked Harry.
Dobbys ears drooped slightly.
``Winky is still drinking lots, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said sadly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enormous round green eyes, large as tennis
balls, downcast. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) still does not care for clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves.
None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower any more, not with the hats and socks hidden
everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir. Dobby does it all himself, sir, but Dobby does not
mind, sir, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) has got his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) wish!'' Dobby
sank into a deep bow again. ``But Harry Potter does not seem happy,'' Dobby went on,
straightening up again and looking timidly at Harry. ``Dobby heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) muttering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) sleep.
Was Harry Potter having bad dreams?''
``Not really bad,'' said Harry, yawning and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes. ``Ive had worse.''
The elf surveyed Harry out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vast, orb-like eyes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said very seriously, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears
drooping, ``Dobby wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) could help Harry Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby
is much, much happier now.''
Harry smiled.
``You cant help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bent and picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Potions book. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d have to try to finish the essay tomorrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
closed the book and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hand - the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) detentions with Umbridge...
``Wait a moment - there is something you can do for me, Dobby,'' said Harry slowly.
The elf looked round, beaming.
``Name it, Harry Potter, sir!''
``I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts
without being discovered by any of the teachers. Especially,'' Harry clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand on the
book, so that the scars shone pearly white, ``Professor Umbridge.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) expected the elfs smile to vanish, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears to droop; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to say it was
impossible, or else that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would try to find somewhere, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hopes were not high. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had not expected was for Dobby to give a little skip, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears waggling cheerfully, and clap his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hands together.
``Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said happily. ``Dobby heard tell of it from the other
house-elves when he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) came to Hogwarts, sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or
else as the Room of Requirement!''
``Why?'' said Harry curiously.
``Because it is a room that a person can only enter,'' said Dobby seriously, ``when they have real
need of it. Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always
equipped for the seekers needs. Dobby has used it, sir,'' said the elf, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice and
looking guilty, ``when Winky has been very drunk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winky</b></font>) has hidden her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in the Room of
Requirement and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winky</b></font>) has found antidotes to Butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
on while she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sleeps it off, sir... and Dobby knows Mr. Filch has found extra cleaning materials
there when he (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>) has run short, sir, and -''
``And if you really needed a bathroom,'' said Harry, suddenly remembering something
Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, ``would it fill itself with chamber
pots?''
``Dobby expects so, sir,'' said Dobby, nodding earnestly. ``It is a most amazing room, sir.''
``How many people know about it?'' said Harry, sitting up straighter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair.
``Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, sir, but often they never
finds it again, for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service, sir.''
``It sounds brilliant,'' said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart racing. ``It sounds perfect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is?''
``Any time, Harry Potter, sir,'' said Dobby, looking delighted at Harrys enthusiasm. ``We could go
now, if you like!''
For a moment Harry was tempted to go with Dobby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was halfway out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seat, intending to
hurry upstairs for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like
Hermiones whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ear: reckless. It was, after all, very late, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was exhausted, and had
Snapes essay to finish.
``Not tonight, Dobby,'' said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair. ``This is really
important... I dont want to blow it, itll need proper planning. Listen, can you just tell me
exactly where this Room of Requirement is, and how to get in there?''
Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable
patch to double Herbology, where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over
the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof. The afternoons Care of
Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-swept grounds to a free classroom
on the ground floor and, to their intense relief, Angelina had sought out her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) team at lunch to tell
them that Quidditch practice was cancelled.
``Good,'' said Harry quietly, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), ``because weve found somewhere to have our
first Defense meeting. Tonight, eight oclock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas
the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others. Harry returned hungrily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
sausages and mash. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found Hermione
watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``What?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said thickly.
``Well... its just that Dobbys plans arent always that safe. Dont you remember when he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) lost
you all the bones in your arm?''
``This room isnt just some mad idea of Dobbys; Dumbledore knows about it, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) mentioned
it to me at the Yule Ball.''
Hermiones expression cleared.
``Dumbledore told you about it?''
``Just in passing,'' said Harry, shrugging.
``Oh, well, thats all right then,'' said Hermione briskly and raised no more objections.
Together with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their
names to the list in the Hogs Head and telling them where to meet that evening. Somewhat to
Harrys disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) friend first;
however, by the end of dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) was confident that the news had been passed to every one of
the twenty-five people who had turned up in the Hogs Head.
At half past seven Harry, Ron and Hermione left the Gryffindor common room, Harry clutching
a certain piece of aged parchment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand. Fifth-years were allowed to be out in the corridors
until nine oclock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way
along the seventh floor.
``Hold it,'' Harry warned, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping
it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and muttering, ``I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.''
A map of Hogwarts appeared on the blank surface of the parchment. Tiny black moving dots,
labeled with names, showed where various people were.
``Filch is on the second floor,'' said Harry, holding the map close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, ``and Mrs. Norris is
on the fourth.''
``And Umbridge?'' said Hermione anxiously.
``In her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) office,'' said Harry, pointing. ``Okay, lets go.''
They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry, a stretch of blank
wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmys foolish attempt to train trolls
for the ballet.
``Okay,'' said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) relentless clubbing of the would be ballet teacher to watch them. ``Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times,
concentrating hard on what we need.''
They did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall, then at the man-sized vase on its other side. Ron had screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes in concentration; Hermione was
whispering something under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) breath; Harrys fists were clenched as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stared ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
We need somewhere to learn to fight... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought. Just give us a place to practice... somewhere they cant find us...
``Harry!'' said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their third walk past.
A highly polished door had appeared in the wall. Ron was staring at it, looking slightly wary.
Harry reached out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious
room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below.
The walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs there were large silk cushions
on the floor. A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as
Sneakoscopes, Secrecy Sensors and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure had hung, the
previous year, in the fake Moodys office.
``These will be good when were practicing Stunning, '' said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) foot.
``And just look at these books!'' said Hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the
large leather-bound tomes. ``A Compendium of Common Curses and their Counter-Actions...
The Dark Arts Outsmarted... Self-Defensive Spellwork... wow...'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked around at Harry,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face glowing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced
Hermione that what they were doing was right. ``Harry, this is wonderful, theres everything we
need here!''
And without further ado she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf, sank on to the nearest
cushion and began to read.
There was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked round. Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati
and Dean had arrived.
``Whoa,'' said Dean, staring around, impressed. ``What is this place?''
Harry began to explain, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had finished more people had arrived and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to start all
over again. By the time eight oclock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across
to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and
everybody fell silent, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Hermione carefully marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) page of Jinxes for the
Jinxed and set the book aside.
``Well,'' said Harry, slightly nervously. ``This is the place weve found for practice sessions, and
youve - er - obviously found it okay.''
``Its fantastic!'' said Cho, and several people murmured their agreement.
``Its bizarre,'' said Fred, frowning around at it. ``We once hid from Filch in here, remember,
George? But it was just a broom cupboard then.''
``Hey, Harry, whats this stuff?'' asked Dean from the rear of the room, indicating the
Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass.
``Dark detectors,'' said Harry, stepping between the cushions to reach them. ``Basically they all
show when Dark wizards or enemies are around, but you dont want to rely on them too much,
they can be fooled...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy figures were moving around inside
it, though none was recognizable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back on it.
``Well, Ive been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and - er -'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) noticed a
raised hand. ``What, Hermione?''
``I think we ought to elect a leader,'' said Hermione.
``Harrys leader,'' said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) were mad.
Harrys stomach did yet another back-flip.
``Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,'' said Hermione, unperturbed. ``It makes it
formal and it gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) authority. So - everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?''
Everybody put up their hand, even Zacharias Smith, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) did it very half-heartedly.
``Er - right, thanks,'' said Harry, who could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face burning. ``And -what, Hermione?''
``I also think we ought to have a name,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said brightly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand still in the air. ``It would
promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, dont you think?''
``Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?'' said Angelina hopefully.
``Or the Ministry of Magic are Morons Group?'' suggested Fred.
``I was thinking,'' said Hermione, frowning at Fred, ``more of a name that didnt tell everyone
what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.''
``The Defense Association?'' said Cho. ``The D.A. for short, so nobody knows what were talking
about?''
``Yeah, the D.A.s good,'' said Ginny. ``Only lets make it stand for Dumbledores Army, because
thats the Ministrys worst fear, isnt it?''
There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this.
``All in favor of the D.A.?'' said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cushion to count. ``Thats a
majority - motion passed!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pinned the piece of parchment with all of their signatures on it on to the wall and wrote
across the top in large letters:
``Right,'' said Harry, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had sat down again, ``shall we get practicing then? I was thinking,
the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know its pretty basic but Ive found it really useful -''
``Oh, please,'' said Zacharias Smith, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) eye s and folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) arms. ``I dont think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you?''
``Ive used it against him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),'' said Harry quietly. ``It saved my life in June.''
Smith opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very quiet.
``But if you think its beneath you, you can leave,'' Harry said.
Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else.
``Okay,'' said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth slightly drier than usual with all these eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), ``I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice.''
It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed.
Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless.
``You can practice with me,'' Harry told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Right-on the count of three, then-one, two, three-''
The room was suddenly full of shouts of Expelliarmus. Wands flew in all directions; missed
spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville,
whose wand went spinning out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with
a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.
Glancing around, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been right to suggest they practice the basics first; there was
a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in Disarming their
opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their
feeble spell whooshed over them.
``Expelliarmus!'' said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand fly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand.
``I DID IT!'' said Neville gleefully. ``Ive never done it before - I DID IT!''
``Good one!'' said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel Nevilles
opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand held loosely at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
side. ``Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of
minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?''
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was happening to Zacharias
Smith. Every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldstein</b></font>) own wand would fly
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldstein</b></font>) hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far
to solve the mystery: Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to
point their wands at his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) back.
``Sorry, Harry'' said George hastily, when Harry caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye. ``Couldnt resist.''
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong.
Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) was doing very well, whereas Michael was either
very bad or unwilling to jinx her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>). Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Macmillan</b></font>) wand unnecessarily,
giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Macmillan</b></font>) partner time to get in under his (<font color='blue'><b>Macmillan</b></font>) guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but
erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna
Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchleys wand spinning out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finch-Fletchley</b></font>) hand, at other times merely causing his (<font color='blue'><b>Finch-Fletchley</b></font>) hair to stand on end.
``Okay, stop!'' Harry shouted. ``Stop! STOP!''
I need a whistle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought, and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of
books. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) caught it up and blew hard. Everyone lowered their wands.
``That wasnt bad,'' said Harry, ``but theres definite room for improvement.'' Zacharias Smith
glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Lets try again.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make suggestions. Slowly, the
general performance improved.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) avoided going near Cho and her (<font color='blue'><b>Finch-Fletchley</b></font>) friend for a while, but after walking twice around every other
pair in the room felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not ignore them any longer.
``Oh no,'' said Cho rather wildly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) approached. ``Expelliarmious! I mean, Expellimellius!! I -
oh, sorry, Marietta!''
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Finch-Fletchley</b></font>) curly-haired friends sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extinguished it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) own wand and
glared at Harry as though it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fault.
``You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!'' Cho told Harry ruefully.
``That was quite good,'' Harry lied, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) eyebrows he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, ``Well, no, it was
lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I was watching from over there.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) laughed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away.
``Dont mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>),'' Cho muttered. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) doesnt really want to be here but I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) come with
me. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) parents have forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) to do anything that might upset Umbridge. You see - her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>)
mum works for the Ministry.''
``What about your parents?'' asked Harry.
``Well, theyve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge, too,'' said Cho, drawing
herself up proudly. ``But if they think Im not going to fight You-Know-Who after what
happened to Cedric -''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell between them; Terry Boots
wand went whizzing past Harrys ear and hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose.
``Well, my dad is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action!'' said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Spinnet</b></font>) had been eavesdropping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) conversation while Justin Finch-Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his (<font color='blue'><b>Finch-Fletchley</b></font>) head. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)s always saying he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)d believe anything of Fudge; I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated! And of course he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) secretly feeds to anybody who disagrees with him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>). And then theres his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) Umgubular
Slashkilter --''
``Dont ask,'' Harry muttered to Cho as she (<font color='blue'><b>Spinnet</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Spinnet</b></font>) mouth, looking puzzled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spinnet</b></font>) giggled.
``Hey, Harry,'' Hermione called from the other end of the room, ``have you checked the time?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watch and was shocked to see it was already ten past nine, which meant
they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished
by Filch for being out of bounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whistle; everybody stopped shouting
``Expelliarmus'' and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor.
``Well, that was pretty good,'' said Harry, ``but weve overrun, wed better leave it here. Same
time, same place next week?''
``Sooner! said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement.
Angelina, however, said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``The Quidditch seasons about to start, we need team practices
too!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lets say next Wednesday night, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``we can decide on additional meetings then. Come on, wed better get going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled out the Marauders Map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the
seventh floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) let them all leave in threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see
that they returned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also
led to the kitchens; the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors
along the corridor to the Fat Ladys portrait.
<div class="bookquote">``That was really, really good, Harry''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, when finally it was just her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), Harry and Ron
who were left.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, it was!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt
back into stone behind them. <div class="bookquote">``Did you see me disarm Hermione, Harry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, stung. <div class="bookquote">``I got you loads more than you got me -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, if youre counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand
out of my hand -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>They argued all the way back to the common room, but Harry was not listening to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
one eye on the Marauders Map, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was also thinking of Cho saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) nervous.
CHAPTER NINETEEN
The Lion and the Serpent
Harry felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were carrying some kind of talisman inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest over the following
two weeks, a glowing secret that supported him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) through Umbridges classes and even made it
possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to smile blandly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) horrible bulging eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and the D.A.
were resisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) under her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) very nose, doing the very thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) and the Ministry most feared,
and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhards book during her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) lessons he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings, remembering how Neville
had successfully disarmed Hermione, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx
after three meetings hard effort, how Parvati Patil had produced such a good Reductor Curse
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Patil</b></font>) had reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to dust.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Creevey</b></font>) was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for the D.A. meetings, as
they had to accommodate three separate teams Quidditch practices, which were often rearranged
due to bad weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry about this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a feeling that it was
probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable. If anyone was watching them,
it would be hard to make out a pattern.
Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next
meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice, because it would
look suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each
other too often. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) gave each of the members of the D.A. a fake Galleon -LRB-Ron became very
excited when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) first saw the basket and was convinced she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was actually giving out gold-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione said, holding one up for
examination at the end of their fourth meeting. The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from
the torches. <div class="bookquote">``On real Galleons thats just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the
coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the
next meeting. The coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if youre carrying them in a
pocket youll be able to feel them. We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next
meeting he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)ll change the numbers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) coin, and because Ive put a Protean Charm on them,
theyll all change to mimic his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>A blank silence greeted Hermiones words. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked around at all the faces upturned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>),
rather disconcerted.
<div class="bookquote">``Well - I thought it was a good idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said uncertainly, <div class="bookquote">``I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, theres nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But... well, if you dont want to use them -''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You can do a Protean Charm?''  (<font color='red'><b>Terry Boot</b></font>)</div>said Terry Boot.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``But thats... thats NEWT standard, that is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boot</b></font>) said weakly.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, trying to look modest. <div class="bookquote">``Oh... well... yes, I suppose it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How come youre not in Ravenclaw?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boot</b></font>) demanded, staring at Hermione with something close
to wonder. <div class="bookquote">``With brains like yours?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said
Hermione brightly, <div class="bookquote">``but it decided on Gryffindor in the end. So, does that mean were using the
Galleons?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forwards to collect one from the basket.
Harry looked sideways at Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``You know what these remind me of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, whats that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Death Eaters scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all their scars burn, and they
know theyve got to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well... yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quietly, <div class="bookquote">``that is where I got the idea but youll notice I decided to
engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members skin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah... I prefer your way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, grinning, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Galleon into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fat chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who was examining his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air, <div class="bookquote">``I havent got any real Galleons to confuse it with.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, drew nearer, their D.A.
meetings were put on hold because Angelina insisted on almost daily practices. The fact that the
Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement
surrounding the forthcoming game; the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest
in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the
Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent
pretence of sportsmanship, were determined to see their own side victorious. Harry realized how
much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) abstained from giving them
homework in the week leading up to the match.
<div class="bookquote">``I think youve got enough to be getting on with at the moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said loftily. Nobody could
quite believe their ears until she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, <div class="bookquote">``Ive become
accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really dont want to have to
hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practice, wont you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Snape was no less obviously partisan; he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice
so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was also turning a deaf ear to
the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the corridors. When Alicia
Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Spinnet</b></font>) eyebrows growing so thick and fast they
obscured her (<font color='blue'><b>Spinnet</b></font>) vision and obstructed her (<font color='blue'><b>Spinnet</b></font>) mouth, Snape insisted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Spinnet</b></font>) must have attempted a
Hair-thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eye-witnesses who
insisted they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Spinnet</b></font>) from behind with a jinx
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Spinnet</b></font>) worked in the library.
Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindors chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoys team.
Admittedly, Ron was still not performing to Woods standard, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was working extremely
hard to improve. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence after he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)d made a
blunder; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) let in one goal he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the
other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was on form; during
one memorable practice he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had hung one-handed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard
away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the
other end; the rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made recently by
Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Polands top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski.
Even Fred had said that Ron might yet make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and George proud, and that they were seriously
considering admitting he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was related to them, something they assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) they had been trying
to deny for four years.
The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of the
Slytherin team to upset him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) before they even got on to the pitch. Harry, of course, had endured
their snide comments for over four years, so whispers of, <div class="bookquote">``Hey, Potty, I heard Warringtons
sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>, far from chilling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) blood, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``Warringtons aims so pathetic Id be more worried if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was aiming for the person next to me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinsons
face.
But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers and intimidation. When
Slytherins, some of them seventh-years and considerably larger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was, muttered as they
passed in the corridors, <div class="bookquote">``Got your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) didnt laugh,
but turned a delicate shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle
-LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) did whenever they came within sight of each other-RRB-, Rons ears glowed red and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
hands shook so badly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was likely to drop whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was holding at the time, too.
October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and November arrived,
cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every morning and icy draughts that bit at exposed hands
and faces. The skies and the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly grey, the mountains
around Hogwarts were snowcapped, and the temperature in the castle dropped so low that many
students wore their thick protective dragon skin gloves in the corridors between lessons.
The morning of the match dawned bright and cold. When Harry awoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked round at Rons
bed and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sitting bolt upright, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) arms around his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) knees, staring fixedly into space.
<div class="bookquote">``You all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
Ron nodded but did not speak. Harry was reminded forcibly of the time Ron had accidentally put
a Slug-vomiting Charm on himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked just as pale and sweaty as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had done then, not to
mention as reluctant to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``You just need some breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said bracingly. <div class="bookquote">``Cmon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Great</b></font>)</div>The Great Hall was filling up fast when they arrived, the talk louder and the mood more
exuberant than usual. As they passed the Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise. Harry
looked round and saw that, in addition to the usual green and silver scarves and hats, every one
of them was wearing a silver badge in the shape of what seemed to be a crown. For some reason
many of them waved at Ron, laughing uproariously. Harry tried to see what was written on the
badges as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked by, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was too concerned to get Ron past their table quickly to linger
long enough to read them.
They received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table, where everyone was wearing red and
gold, but far from raising Rons spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) morale; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
collapsed on to the nearest bench looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) were facing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) final meal.
<div class="bookquote">``I mustve been mental to do this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said in a croaky whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Mental.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont be thick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry firmly, passing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a choice of cereals, <div class="bookquote">``youre going to be fine. Its normal to be nervous.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im rubbish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>croaked Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Im lousy. I cant play to save my life. What was I thinking?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get a grip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry sternly. <div class="bookquote">``Look at that save you made with your foot the other day, even
Fred and George said it was brilliant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron turned a tortured face to Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``That was an accident,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whispered miserably. <div class="bookquote">``I didnt mean to do it - I slipped off my broom
when none of you were looking and when I was trying to get back on I kicked the Quaffle by
accident.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise, <div class="bookquote">``a few more accidents like
that and the games in the bag, isnt it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing red and gold scarves, gloves and rosettes.
<div class="bookquote">``Howre you feeling?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>Ginny asked Ron, who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the
bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in
them.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)s just nervous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, thats a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams if youre not a bit nervous,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione heartily.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them. Harry looked up: Luna Lovegood had
drifted over from the Ravenclaw table. Many people were staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and a few were openly
laughing and pointing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lions head,
which was perched precariously on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Im supporting Gryffindor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>said Luna, pointing un necessarily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``Look what it does...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) reached up and tapped the hat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand. It opened its mouth wide and gave an
extremely realiztic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump.
<div class="bookquote">``Its good, isnt it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>said Luna happily. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent
Slytherin, you know, but there wasnt time. Anyway... good luck, Ronald!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) drifted away. They had not quite recovered from the shock of Lunas hat before Angelina
came hurrying towards them, accompanied by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully
been returned to normal by Madam Pomfrey.
<div class="bookquote">``When youre ready''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``were going to go straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and change.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well be there in a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Rons just got to have some breakfast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capable of eating anything more
and Harry thought it best to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) down to the changing rooms. As they rose from the table,
Hermione got up, too, and taking Harrys arm she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to one side.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont let Ron see whats on those Slytherins badges,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) whispered urgently.
Harry looked questioningly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head warningly; Ron had just ambled over
to them, looking lost and desperate.
<div class="bookquote">``Good luck, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) on the cheek. <div class="bookquote">``And you,
Harry -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) touched
the spot on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face where Hermione had kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), looking puzzled, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was not quite
sure what had just happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) seemed too distracted to notice much around him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), but Harry
cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table, and this time
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) made out the words etched on to them:
Weasley Is Our King
With an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hurried Ron across the
Entrance Hall, down the stone steps and out into the icy air.
The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the sloping lawns towards the
stadium. There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that
visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes. Harry pointed out
these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was not sure that Ron was listening.
Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered. Harry
and Ron pulled on their robes -LRB-Ron attempted to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) up back-to-front for several minutes
before Alicia took pity on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and went to help-RRB-, then sat down to listen to the pre-match talk
while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the
castle towards the pitch.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, Ive only just found out the final line-up for Slytherin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment. <div class="bookquote">``Last years Beaters, Derrick and Bole, have left, but it looks as though Montagues replaced them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly particularly well. Theyre two blokes called Crabbe and goyle, I dont know much about them-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry and Ron together.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, they dont look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from the other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina,
pocketing her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) parchment, <div class="bookquote">``but then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find
their way on to the pitch without signposts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mould,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>).
They could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators stands.
Some people were singing, though Harry could not make out the words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was starting to feel
nervous, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) butterflies were as nothing compared to Rons, who was clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
stomach and staring straight ahead again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) jaw set and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) complexion pale grey.
<div class="bookquote">``Its time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina in a hushed voice, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Cmon everyone... good
luck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The team rose, shouldered their brooms and marched in single file out of the changing room and
into the dazzling sunlight. A roar of sound greeted them in which Harry could still hear singing,
though it was muffled by the cheers and whistles.
The Slytherin team was standing waiting for them. They, too, were wearing those silver crownshaped badges. The new Captain, Montague, was built along the same lines as Dudley Dursley, with massive forearms like hairy hams. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dursley</b></font>) lurked Crabbe and Goyle, almost as large, blinking stupidly in the sunlight, swinging their new Beaters bats. Malfoy stood to one side, the sunlight gleaming on his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) white-blond head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) caught Harrys eye and smirked, tapping the crown-shaped badge on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest.
<div class="bookquote">``Captains, shake hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>referee</b></font>)</div>ordered the referee Madam Hooch, as Angelina and Montague reached
each other. Harry could tell that Montague was trying to crush Angelinas fingers, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) did
not wince. <div class="bookquote">``Mount your brooms...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Madam Hooch placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) whistle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) mouth and blew.
The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upwards. Out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye Harry
saw Ron streak off towards the goal hoops. Harry zoomed higher, dodging a Bludger, and set off
on a wide lap of the pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other side of the stadium,
Draco Malfoy was doing exactly the same.
<div class="bookquote">``And its Johnson - Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl is, Ive been saying it for
years but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still wont go out with me -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``JORDAN!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>yelled Professor McGonagall.
<div class="bookquote">''- just a fun fact, Professor, adds a bit of interest - and she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)s ducked Warrington, she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)s passed
Montague, she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)s -- ouch - been hit from behind by a Bludger from Crabbe... Montague catches
the Quaffle, Montague heading back up the pitch and - nice Bludger there from George Weasley,
thats a Bludger to the head for Montague, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) drops the Quaffle, caught by Katie Bell, Katie Bell
of Gryffindor reverse-passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnets away -''
 (<font color='red'><b>McGonagall/Minerva/Minerva McGonagall</b></font>)</div>Lee Jordans commentary rang through the stadium and Harry listened as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
through the wind whistling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears and the din of the crowd, all yelling and booing and
singing.
<div class="bookquote">''- dodges Warrington, avoids a Bludger - close call, Alicia - and the crowd are loving this, just
listen to them, whats that theyre singing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as Lee paused to listen, the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the
Slytherin section of the stands:
<div class="bookquote">``Weasley cannot save a thing, He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) cannot block a single ring, Thats why Slytherins all sing:
Weasley is our King.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Slytherin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Weasley was born in a bin He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) always lets the Quaffle in Weasley will make sure we win
Weasley is our King.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''--and Alicia passes back to Angelina!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan</b></font>)</div>Lee shouted, and as Harry swerved, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides boiling
at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew Lee was trying to drown out the words of the song. <div class="bookquote">``Come on
now, Angelina -- looks like she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>)s got just the Keeper to beat! - SHE SHOOTS - SHE - aaaah...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bletchley</b></font>)</div>Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>) threw the Quaffle to Warrington who
sped off with it, zig-zagging in between Alicia and Katie; the singing from below grew louder
and louder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>) drew nearer and nearer Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) always lets the Quaffle in Weasley is our King.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry could not help himself: abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) search for the Snitch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wheeled around to watch
Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch, hovering before the three goal hoops while the
massive Warrington pelted towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">''- and its Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington heading for goal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s out of Bludger range
with just the Keeper ahead -''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands below:
<div class="bookquote">``Weasley cannot save a thing, He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) cannot block a single ring...''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Slytherin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- so its the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper Weasley, brother of Beaters Fred and George,
and a promising new talent on the team - come on, Ron!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Slytherin</b></font>)</div>But the scream of delight came from the Slytherins end: Ron had dived wildly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) arms wide,
and the Quaffle had soared between them straight through Rons central hoop.
<div class="bookquote">``Slytherin score!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan</b></font>)</div>came Lees voice amid the cheering and booing from the crowds below, <div class="bookquote">``so
thats ten-nil to Slytherin - bad luck, Ron.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan</b></font>)</div>The Slytherins sang even louder:
<div class="bookquote">``WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN, HE (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN...''
 (<font color='red'><b>The Slytherins</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- and Gryffindor back in possession and its Katie Bell tanking up the pitch -''  (<font color='red'><b>The Slytherins</b></font>)</div>cried Lee
valiantly, though the singing was now so deafening that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) could hardly make himself heard
above it.
<div class="bookquote">``WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN WEASLEY IS OUR KING...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>screamed Angelina, soaring past him (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) to keep up with
Katie. <div class="bookquote">``GET GOING!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been stationary in midair for over a minute, watching the progress of the
match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the Snitch; horrified, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went into a dive
and started circling the pitch again, staring around, trying to ignore the chorus now thundering
through the stadium:
<div class="bookquote">``WEASLEY IS OUR KING, WEASLEY IS OUR KING...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked; Malfoy was still circling the stadium just as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was. They passed one another midway around the pitch, going in opposite directions, and
Harry heard Malfoy singing loudly:
<div class="bookquote">``WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''--and its Warrington again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>bellowed Lee, <div class="bookquote">``who passes to Pucey, Puceys off past Spinnet,
come on now, Angelina, you can take him (<font color='blue'><b>WEASLEY</b></font>) - turns out you cant - but nice Bludger from Fred

the Quaffle and Katie Bell -- er - drops it, too - so thats Montague with the Quaffle, Slytherin
Captain Montague takes the Quaffle and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)s off up the pitch, come on now, Gryffindor, block
him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan</b></font>)</div>Harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the Slytherin goal hoops, willing himself not
to look at what was going on at Rons end. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sped past the Slytherin Keeper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>) heard
Bletchley singing along with the crowd below:
<div class="bookquote">``WEASLEY CANNOT SAVE A THING...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bletchley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- and Puceys dodged Alicia again and he (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>)s heading straight for goal, stop it, Ron!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bletchley</b></font>)</div>Harry did not have to look to see what had happened: there was a terrible groan from the
Gryffindor end, coupled with fresh screams and applause from the Slytherins. Looking down,
Harry saw the pug-faced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) back to the pitch as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) conducted the Slytherin supporters who were roaring:
<div class="bookquote">``THATS WHY SLYTHERINS ALL SING WEASLEY ISOUR KING.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Slytherin supporters</b></font>)</div>But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch. A
few goals and they would be in the lead as usual, Harry assured himself, bobbing and weaving
through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be Montagues
watchstrap.
But Ron let in two more goals. There was an edge of panic in Harrys desire to find the Snitch
now. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could just get it soon and finish the game quickly.
<div class="bookquote">''- and Katie Bell of Gryffindor dodges Pucey, ducks Montague, nice swerve, Katie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Harry could hear Lunas ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the Gryffindor cheers and felt
heartened; only thirty points in it, that was nothing, they could pull back easily. Harry ducked a
Bludger that Crabbe had sent rocketing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) direction and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) frantic scouring of the
pitch for the Snitch, keeping one eye on Malfoy in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) showed signs of having spotted it, but
Malfoy, like him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), was continuing to soar around the stadium, searching fruitlessly...
<div class="bookquote">''-- Pucey throws to Warrington, Warrington to Montague, Montague back to Pucey -Johnson

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But Harry had seen it at last: the tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was hovering feet from the ground
at the Slytherin end of the pitch.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dived...
In a matter of seconds, Malfoy was streaking out of the sky on Harrys left, a green and silver
blur lying flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom...
The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops and scooted off towards the other side of the
stands; its change of direction suited Malfoy, who was nearer; Harry pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Firebolt around,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Malfoy were now neck and neck...
Feet from the ground, Harry lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom, stretching towards the
Snitch... to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right, Malfoys arm extended too, was reaching, groping...
It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds - Harrys fingers closed around the
tiny, struggling ball - Malfoys fingernails scrabbled the back of Harrys hand hopelessly - Harry
pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom upwards, holding the struggling ball in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand and the Gryffindor spectators
screamed their approval...
They were saved, it did not matter that Ron had let in those goals, nobody would remember as
long as Gryffindor had won -
WHAM.
A Bludger hit Harry squarely in the small of the back and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flew forwards off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom.
Luckily he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was only five or six feet above the ground, having dived so low to catch the Snitch,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was winded all the same as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) landed flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back on the frozen pitch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard
Madam Hoochs shrill whistle, an uproar in the stands compounded of catcalls, angry yells and
jeering, a thud, then Angelinas frantic voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Course I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry grimly, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) hand and allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet.
Madam Hooch was zooming towards one of the Slytherin players above him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
not see who it was from this angle.
<div class="bookquote">``It was that thug Crabbe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina angrily, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) whacked the Bludger at you the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) saw youd got the Snitch - but we won, Harry, we won!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>Harry heard a snort from behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and turned around, still holding the Snitch tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hand: Draco Malfoy had landed close by. White-faced with fury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was still managing to sneer.
<div class="bookquote">``Saved Weasleys neck, havent you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) said to Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Ive never seen a worse Keeper... but
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was born in a bin... did you like my lyrics, Potter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry didnt answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by
one, yelling and punching the air in triumph; all except Ron, who had dismounted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
broom over by the goalposts and seemed to be making his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) way slowly back to the changing
rooms alone.
<div class="bookquote">``We wanted to write another couple of verses!''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>Malfoy called, as Katie and Alicia hugged Harry. <div class="bookquote">``But we couldnt find rhymes for fat and ugly - we wanted to sing about his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) mother, see-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Talk about sour grapes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina, casting Malfoy a disgusted look.
<div class="bookquote">''- we couldnt fit in useless loser either - for his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) father, you know -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>Fred and George had realized what Malfoy was talking about. Halfway through shaking Harrys
hand, they stiffened, looking round at Malfoy.
<div class="bookquote">``Leave it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina at once, taking Fred by the arm. <div class="bookquote">``Leave it, Fred, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) yell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)s just
sore he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) lost, the jumped-up little -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- but you like the Weasleys, dont you, Potter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy, sneering. <div class="bookquote">``Spend holidays there
and everything, dont you? Cant see how you stand the stink, but I suppose when youve been
dragged up by Muggles, even the Weasleys hovel smells okay -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry grabbed hold of George. Meanwhile, it was taking the combined efforts of Angelina,
Alicia and Katie to stop Fred leaping on Malfoy, who was laughing openly. Harry looked around
for Madam Hooch, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) was still berating Crabbe for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) illegal Sludger attack.
<div class="bookquote">``Or perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy, leering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) backed away, <div class="bookquote">``you can remember what your mothers
house stank like, Potter, and Weasleys pigsty reminds you of it --''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew was that a second later both of them were
sprinting towards Malfoy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had completely forgotten that all the teachers were watching: all he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as possible; with no time to draw out his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) wand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) could into Malfoys
stomach -
<div class="bookquote">``Harry! HARRY! GEORGE! NO''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoys</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) could hear girls voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George swearing, a whistle blowing and
the bellowing of the crowd around him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) did not care. Not until somebody in the vicinity
yelled <div class="bookquote">``Impedimenta!''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was knocked over backwards by the force of the spell, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
abandon the attempt to punch every inch of Malfoy he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) could reach.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you think youre doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Hooch</b></font>)</div>screamed Madam Hooch, as Harry leapt to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. It seemed to have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) who had hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with the Impediment Jinx; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) whistle
in one hand and a wand in the other; her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) broom lay abandoned several feet away. Malfoy was curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) nose bloody; George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the background. <div class="bookquote">``Ive never seen behavior like it - back up to the castle, both of you, and straight to your Head of Houses office! Go! Now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and George turned on their heels and marched off the pitch, both panting, neither saying a
word to the other. The howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they
reached the Entrance Hall, where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own
footsteps. Harry became aware that something was still struggling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right hand, the knuckles
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had bruised against Malfoys jaw. Looking down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) saw the Snitchs silver wings
protruding from between his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) fingers, struggling for release.
They had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagalls office when she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) came marching
along the corridor behind them. She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) was wearing a Gryffindor scarf, but tore it from her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) throat
with shaking hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) strode towards them, looking livid.
<div class="bookquote">``In!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said furiously, pointing to the door. Harry and George entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) strode around
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) desk and faced them, quivering with rage as she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) threw the Gryffindor scarf aside on
to the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition. Two on one! Explain
yourselves!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Malfoy provoked us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry stiffly.
<div class="bookquote">``Provoked you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>shouted Professor McGonagall, slamming a fist on to her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) desk so that her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) tartan tin slid sideways off it and burst open, littering the floor with Ginger Newts. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)d just lost, hadnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)? Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) wanted to provoke you! But what on earth he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) can have said that justified what you two --''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) insulted my parents,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>snarled George. <div class="bookquote">``And Harrys mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two decided to give an exhibition of
Muggle dueling, did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>bellowed Professor McGonagall. <div class="bookquote">``Have you any idea what youve -
?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hem, hem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and George both wheeled round. Dolores Umbridge was standing in the doorway wrapped
in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) resemblance to a giant toad, and was smiling in
the horrible, sickly, ominous way that Harry had come to associate with imminent misery.
<div class="bookquote">``May I help, Professor McGonagall?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>asked Professor Umbridge in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) most poisonously sweet
voice.
Blood rushed into Professor McGonagalls face.
<div class="bookquote">``Help?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) repeated, in a constricted voice. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, help?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge moved forwards into the office, still smiling her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) sickly smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Professor McGonagalls nostrils.
<div class="bookquote">``You thought wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) back on Umbridge.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, you two had better listen closely. I do not care what provocation Malfoy offered you, I do
not care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) insulted every family member you possess, your behavior was disgusting and I
am giving each of you a weeks worth of detentions! Do not look at me like that, Potter, you
deserve it! And if either of you ever -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hem, hem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall closed her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) eyes as though praying for patience as she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) face
towards Professor Umbridge again.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think they deserve rather more than detentions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, smiling still more broadly.
Professor McGonagalls eyes flew open.
<div class="bookquote">``But unfortunately''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said, with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) look as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) had lockjaw, <div class="bookquote">``it is what I think that counts, as they are in my House, Dolores.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, actually, Minerva,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>simpered Professor Umbridge, <div class="bookquote">``I think youll find that what I
think does count. Now, where is it? Cornelius just sent it... I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) gave a false little laugh
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) rummaged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) handbag, <div class="bookquote">``the Minister just sent it... ah yes...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had pulled out a piece of parchment which she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) now unfurled, clearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) throat fussily
before starting to read what it said.
<div class="bookquote">``Hem, hem... Educational Decree Number Twenty-five.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not another one!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, still smiling. <div class="bookquote">``As a matter of fact, Minerva, it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment... you remember how you overrode me, when I was
unwilling to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form? How you took the case to
Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play? Well, now, I couldnt have that. I
contacted the Minister at once, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have
the power to strip pupils of privileges, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) - that is to say, I - would have less authority than
common teachers! And you see now, dont you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop
the Gryffindor team re-forming? Dreadful tempers... anyway, I was reading out our
amendment... hem, hem... High Inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all
punishments, sanctions and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts, and the
power to alter such punishments, sanctions and removals of privileges as may have been ordered
by other staff members. Signed, Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, Order of Merlin First
Class, etc., etc.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) rolled up the parchment and put it back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) handbag, still smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``So... I really think I will have to ban these two from playing Quidditch ever again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said,
looking from Harry to George and back again.
Harry felt the Snitch fluttering madly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Ban us?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice sounded strangely distant. <div class="bookquote">``From playing... ever again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Potter, I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) smile widening
still further as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) struggle to comprehend what she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had said. <div class="bookquote">``You and Mr. Weasley here. And I think, to be safe, this young mans twin ought to be stopped, too - if his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teammates had not restrained him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I feel sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as well. I will want their broomsticks confiscated, of course; I shall keep them safely in my office, to make sure there is no infringement of my ban. But I am not unreasonable, Professor McGonagall,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) continued, turning back to Professor McGonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no signs of violence from any of them. Well... good afternoon to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>And with a look of the utmost satisfaction, Umbridge left the room, leaving a horrified silence in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wake.
<div class="bookquote">``Banned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina in a hollow voice, late that evening in the common room. <div class="bookquote">``Banned. No
Seeker and no Beaters... what on earth are we going to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It did not feel as though they had won the match at all. Everywhere Harry looked there were
disconsolate and angry faces; the team themselves were slumped around the fire, all apart from
Ron, who had not been seen since the end of the match.
<div class="bookquote">``Its just so unfair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Alicia Spinnet/Spinnet</b></font>)</div>said Alicia numbly. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, what about Crabbe and that Bludger he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) hit after the whistle had been blown? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) banned him (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny miserably; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) and Hermione were sitting on either side of Harry. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) just got
lines, I heard Montague laughing about it at dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And banning Fred when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) didnt even do anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Alicia Spinnet/Spinnet</b></font>)</div>said Alicia furiously, pummeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)
knee with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) fist.
<div class="bookquote">``Its not my fault I didnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, with a very ugly look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) face, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldve pounded the
little scumbag to a pulp if you three hadnt been holding me back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Harry stared miserably at the dark window. Snow was falling. The Snitch he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) had caught earlier
was now zooming around and around the common room; people were watching its progress as
though hypnotized and Crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair, trying to catch it.
<div class="bookquote">``Im going to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina, getting slowly t o her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream... maybe Ill wake up tomorrow and find we havent played yet...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) was soon followed by Alicia and Katie. Fred and George sloped off to bed some time later,
glowering at everyone they passed, and Ginny went not long after that. Only Harry and
Hermione were left beside the fire.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you seen Ron?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked in a low voice.
Harry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s avoiding us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Where d o you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fat</b></font>)</div>But at that precise moment, there was a creaking sound behind them as the Fat Lady swung
forwards and Ron came clambering through the portrait hole. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was very pale indeed and there
was snow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hair. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) saw Harry and Hermione, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stopped dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tracks.
<div class="bookquote">``Where have you been?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione anxiously, springing up.
<div class="bookquote">``Walking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron mumbled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was still wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) Quidditch things.
<div class="bookquote">``You look frozen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Come and sit down!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair furthest from Harrys, not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). The
stolen Snitch zoomed over their heads.
<div class="bookquote">``Im sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron mumbled, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet.
<div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``For thinking I can play Quidditch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Im going to resign first thing tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you resign,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry testily, <div class="bookquote">``therell only be three players left on the team.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>And when Ron looked puzzled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Ive been given a lifetime ban. Sove Fred and George.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron yelped.
Hermione told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) the full story; Harry could not bear to tell it again. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had finished,
Ron looked more anguished than ever.
<div class="bookquote">``This is all my fault -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You didnt make me punch Malfoy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry angrily.
<div class="bookquote">''- if I wasnt so terrible at Quidditch -''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- it was that song that wound me up -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- it wouldve wound anyone up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione got up and walked to the window, away from the argument, watching the snow
swirling down against the pane.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, drop it, will you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry burst out. <div class="bookquote">``Its bad enough, without you blaming yourself for
everything!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) robes. After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said in
a dull voice, <div class="bookquote">``This is the worst Ive ever felt in my life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Join the club,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry bitterly.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) voice trembling slightly. <div class="bookquote">``I can think of one thing that might cheer
you both up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry skeptically.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, turning away from the pitch-black, snow-flecked window, a broad smile
spreading across her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Hagrids back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER TWENTY
Hagrids Tale
Harry sprinted up to the boys dormitories to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauders
Map from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so quick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes
before Hermione hurried back down from the girls dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves and one of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) own knobbly elf hats.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, its cold out there!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said defensively, as Ron clicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tongue impatiently.
They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the Cloak - Ron had
grown so much he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) now needed to crouch to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet showing - then, moving slowly and
cautiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check on the map
for signs of Filch or Mrs. Norris. They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick,
who was gliding along absent-mindedly humming something that sounded horribly like
Weasley is our King. They crept across the Entrance Hall and out into the silent, snowy
grounds. With a great leap of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke
coiling up from Hagrids chimney. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and
bumping along behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). They crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last
they reached the wooden front door. When Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fist and knocked three times, a dog
started barking frantically inside.
<div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, its us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry called through the keyhole.
<div class="bookquote">``Shoulda known!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a gruff voice.
They beamed at each other under the Cloak; they could tell by Hagrids voice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
pleased. <div class="bookquote">``Bin home three seconds... out the way, Fang... out the way, yeh dozy dog...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open and Hagrids head appeared in the gap.
Hermione screamed.
<div class="bookquote">``Merlins beard, keep it down!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. <div class="bookquote">``Under that
Cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and
pulled the Cloak off themselves so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see them. <div class="bookquote">``I just - oh, Hagrid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its nuthin, its nuthin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to
close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in horror.
Hagrids hair was matted with congealed blood and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit
amid a mass of purple and black bruising. There were many cuts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face and hands, some of
them still bleeding, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was
obvious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had only just got home; a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair
and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the
door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man, was now limping over to the fire and
placing a copper kettle over it.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick
their faces.
<div class="bookquote">``Told yeh, nuthin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Want a cuppa?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come off it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, <div class="bookquote">``youre in a right state!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im tellin yeh, Im fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but
wincing. <div class="bookquote">``Blimey, its good ter see yeh three again - had good summers, did yeh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, youve been attacked!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Fer the las time, its nuthin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid firmly.
<div class="bookquote">``Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``some of those
cuts look nasty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im dealin with it, all righ?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid repressively.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) cabin and
twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged
steak slightly larger than the average car tire.
<div class="bookquote">``Youre not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, leaning in for a closer look. <div class="bookquote">``It looks
poisonous.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its sposed ter look like that, its dragon meat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid said. <div class="bookquote">``An I didn get it ter eat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face. Greenish blood trickled down
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) beard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) gave a soft moan of satisfaction.
<div class="bookquote">``Thas better. It helps with the stingin, yeh know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So, are you going to tell us whats happened to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Cant, Harry. Top secret. Moren me jobs worth ter tell yeh that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>asked Hermione quietly.
Hagrids fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest.
<div class="bookquote">``Giants?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) belt and slapping it back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
face, <div class="bookquote">``who said anythin abou giants? Who yeh bin talkin to? Whos told yeh what Ive - whos
said Ive bin - eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We guessed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione apologetically.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeh did, did yeh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, surveying her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sternly with the eye that was not hidden by
the steak.
<div class="bookquote">``It was kind of... obvious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. Harry nodded.
Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak back on to the table and strode over to the
kettle, which was now whistling.
<div class="bookquote">``Never known kids like you three fer knowin moren yeh oughta,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) muttered, splashing
boiling water into three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bucket-shaped mugs. <div class="bookquote">``An Im not complimentin yeh, neither.
Nosy, somed call it. Interferin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) beard twitched.
<div class="bookquote">``So you have been to look for giants?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, grinning as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat down at the table.
Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) steak again and slapped it back
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, all righ,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grunted, <div class="bookquote">``I have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you found them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a hushed voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, theyre not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Pretty big, see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Mountains,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid unhelpfully.
<div class="bookquote">``So why dont Muggles -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid darkly. <div class="bookquote">``Ony their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin
accidents, aren they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, Hagrid, tell us what youve been up to!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the Dementors -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid choked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mug and dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea and
dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid,
with a soft splat, on to the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Whadda yeh mean, attacked by Dementors?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>growled Hagrid.
<div class="bookquote">``Didnt you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), wide-eyed.
<div class="bookquote">``I don know anythin thats bin happenin since I left. I was on a secret mission, wasn I, didn
wan owls followin me all over the place - ruddy Dementors! Yehre not serious?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the
Ministry of Magic expelled me -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``WHAT?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You were expelled!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell us about your summer and Ill tell you about mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) one open eye. Harry looked right back, an expression of
innocent determination on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, all righ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid said in a resigned voice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fangs mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Hagrid, dont, its not hygien--''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione began, but Hagrid had already slapped the meat
back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) swollen eye.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) took another fortifying gulp of tea, then said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, we set off righ after term ended -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Madame Maxime went with you, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Hermione interjected.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, thas righ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face
that were not obscured by beard or green steak. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, it was jus the pair of us. An Ill tell yeh
this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)s not afraid of roughin it, Olympe. Yeh know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)s a fine, well-dressed woman, an
knowin where we was goin I wondered ow she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)d feel abou clamberin over boulders an
sleepin in caves an tha, bu she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) never complained once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You knew where you were going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry repeated. <div class="bookquote">``You knew where the giants were?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Dumbledore knew, an he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) told us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid.
<div class="bookquote">``Are they hidden?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Is it a secret, where they are?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not really''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shaggy head. <div class="bookquote">``Its jus that mos wizards aren bothered
where they are,s long as its a good long way away. But where they ares very difficult ter get
ter, fer humans anyway, so we needed Dumbledores instructions. Took us abou a month ter get
there -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A month?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had never heard o f a journey lasting such a ridiculously long
time. <div class="bookquote">``But - why couldnt you just grab a Portkey or something?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>There was an odd expression in Hagrids unobscured eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) surveyed Ron; it was almost
pitying.
<div class="bookquote">``Were bein watched, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said gruffly.
<div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeh don understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``The Ministrys keepin an eye on Dumbledore an anyone
they reckons in league with im, an -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We know about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly keen to hear the rest of Hagrids story, <div class="bookquote">``we know
about the Ministry watching Dumbledore -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So you couldnt use magic to get there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>asked Ron, looking thunderstruck, <div class="bookquote">``you had to act like
Muggles all the way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, not exactly all the way''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid cagily. <div class="bookquote">``We jus had ter be careful, cause Olympe an me, we stick out a bit --''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea.
<div class="bookquote">''- so were not hard ter follow. We was pretendin we was goin on holiday together, so we got
inter France an we made like we was headin fer where Olympes school is, cause we knew we
was bein tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, cause Im not really sposed
ter use magic an we knew the Ministryd be lookin fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed
ter give the berk tailin us the slip round abou Dee-John --''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ooooh, Dijon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``Ive been there on holiday, did you see -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) fell silent at the look on Rons face.
``We chanced a bit o magic after that an it wasn a bad journey. Ran inter a couple o mad trolls
on the Polish border an I had a sligh disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, bu apart
from tha couldnta bin smoother.
``An then we reached the place, an we started trekkin up through the mountains, lookin fer
signs of em...
<div class="bookquote">``We had ter lay off the magic once we got near em. Partly cause they don like wizards an we
didn want ter put their backs up too soon, an partly cause Dumbledore had warned us You-
Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an all. Said it was odds on he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)d sent a messenger
off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin attention ter ourselves as we got
nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid paused for a long draught of tea.
<div class="bookquote">``Go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry urgently.
<div class="bookquote">``Found em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid baldly. <div class="bookquote">``Went over a ridge one nigh an there they was, spread ou
underneath us. Little fires burnin below an huge shadows... it was like watchin bits o the
mountain movin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How big are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Ron in a hushed voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Bout twenty feet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid casually. <div class="bookquote">``Some o the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And how many were there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>asked Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``I reckon abou seventy or eighty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Yep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid sadly, <div class="bookquote">``eighty left, an there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diffrent
tribes from all over the world. Bu theyve bin dyin out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o
course, bu mostly they killed each other, an now theyre dyin out faster than ever. Theyre not
made ter live bunched up together like tha. Dumbledore says its our fault, it was the wizards
who forced em to go an made em live a good long way from us an they had no choice bu ter
stick together fer their own protection.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``you saw them and then what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, we waited till morning, didn want ter go sneakin up on em in the dark, fer our own
safety,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. ``Bout three in the mornin they fell asleep jus where they was sittin. We
didn dare sleep. Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of em woke up an came up
where we were, an fer another, the snorin was unbelievable. Caused an avalanche near
mornin.
``Anyway, once it was light we wen down ter see em.''
``Just like that?'' said Ron, looking awestruck. ``You just walked right into a giant camp?''
``Well, Dumbledored told us how ter do it,'' said Hagrid. ``Give the Gurg gifts, show some
respect, yeh know.''
``Give the what gifts?'' asked Harry.
``Oh, the Gurg - means the chief.''
``How could you tell which one was the Gurg?'' asked Ron.
Hagrid grunted in amusement.
``No problem,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was the biggest, the ugliest an the laziest. Sittin there waitin ter be
brought food by the others. Dead goats an such like. Name o Karkus. Id put him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) at twenty-two, twenty-three feet an the weight o a couple o bull elephants. Skin like rhino hide an all.''
``And you just walked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)?'' said Hermione breathlessly.
``Well... down ter him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), where he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was lyin in the valley. They was in this dip between four pretty
high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an Karkus was lyin by the lake roarin at the
others ter feed him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) an his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) wife. Olympe an I went down the mountainside -''
``But didnt they try and kill you when they saw you?'' asked Ron incredulously.
``It was defnitely on some o their minds,'' said Ha grid, shrugging, ``but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an keep our eyes on the Gurg an ignore the others. So thas what we did. An the rest of em went quiet an watched us pass an we got right up ter Karkuss feet an we bowed an put our present down in front o him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>).''
``What do you give a giant?'' asked Ron eagerly. ``Food?''
``Nah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) can get food all righ fer himself,'' said Hagrid. ``We took him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) magic. Giants like magic, jus don like us usin it against em. Anyway, that firs day we gave im a branch o Gubraithian fire.''
Hermione said, ``Wow!'' softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement.
``A branch of -?''
``Everlasting fire,'' said Hermione irritably, ``you ought to know that by now. Professor Flitwicks
mentioned it at least twice in class!''
``Well, anyway,'' said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, ``Dumbledored bewitched this branch to burn fer evermore, which isn somethin any wizard could do, an so I lies it down in the snow by Karkuss feet and says, A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) respectful greetings.''
``And what did Karkus say?'' asked Harry eagerly.
``Nothin,'' said Hagrid. ``Didn speak English.''
``Youre kidding!''
``Didn matter,'' said Hagrid imperturbably, ``Dumbledore had warned us tha migh happen.
Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o giants who knew our lingo an they translated fer us.''
``And did he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) like the present?'' asked Ron.
``Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,'' said Hagrid, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) swollen eye. ``Very pleased. So then I said,
Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) messenger when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) returns tomorrow with another
gift.''
``Why couldnt you speak to them that day?'' asked Hermione.
``Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,'' said Hagrid. ``Let em see we kept our
promises. Well come back tomorrow with another present, an then we do come back with
another present - gives a good impression, see? An gives them time ter test out the firs present
an find out its a good one, an get em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus -
overload em with information an theyll kill yeh jus to simplify things. So we bowed outta the
way an went off an found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an the followin
mornin we went back an this time we found Karkus sittin up waitin fer us lookin all eager.''
``And you talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?''
``Oh yeah. Firs we presented him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with a nice battle helmet -goblin-made an indestructible, yeh
know - an then we sat down an we talked.''
``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) say?''
``Not much,'' said Hagrid. ``Listened mostly. Bu there were good signs. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)d heard o
Dumbledore, heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)d argued against the killin o the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter
be quite intrested in what Dumbledore had ter say. An a few o the others, specially the ones
who had some English, they gathered round an listened too. We were hopeful when we left that
day. Promised ter come back next mornin with another present...
<div class="bookquote">``Bu that night it all wen wrong.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dyou mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, like I say, theyre not meant ter live together, giants,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid sadly. <div class="bookquote">``Not in big
groups like that. They can help themselves, they half kill each other every few weeks. The men
fight each other an the women fight each other; the remnants of the old tribes fight each other,
an thats even without squabbles over food an the best fires an sleepin spots. Yehd think,
seein as how their whole race is abou finished, theyd lay off each other, bu...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid sighed deeply.
<div class="bookquote">``That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin down on the valley.
Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn believe the noise. An when the sun came up the snow was
scarlet an his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) head was lyin at the bottom o the lake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whose head?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>gasped Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Karkuss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid heavily. <div class="bookquote">``There was a new Gurg, Golgomath.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sighed deeply.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, we hadn bargained on a new Gurg two days after wed made friendly contact with the firs one, an we had a funny feelin Golgomath wouldn be so keen ter listen to us, bu we had ter try.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You went to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Ron incredulously. <div class="bookquote">``After youd watched him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) rip off another
giants head?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Course we did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, ``we hadn gone all that way ter give up after two days! We wen
down with the next present wed meant ter give ter Karkus.
``I knew it was no go before Id opened me mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was sitting there wearin Karkuss helmet,
leerin at us as we got nearer. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)s massive, one o the biggest ones there. Black hair an
matchin teeth an a necklace o bones. Human-lookin bones, some of em. Well, I gave it a go -
held out a great roll o dragon skin - an said, gift fer the Gurg of the giants -- Nex thing I
knew, I was hangin upside-down in the air by me feet, two of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mates had grabbed me.''
Hermione clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth.
``How did you get out of that?'' asked Harry.
``Wouldnta done if Olympe hadn bin there,'' said Hagrid. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pulled out her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wand an did some o the fastes spellwork Ive ever seen. Ruddy marvellous. Hit the two holdin me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an they dropped me straightaway - bu we were in trouble then, cause wed used magic against em, an thats what giants hate abou wizards. We had ter leg it an we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter the camp again.''
``Blimey, Hagrid,'' said Ron quietly.
``So, how come its taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?'' asked
Hermione.
``We didn leave after three days!'' said Hagrid, looking outraged. ``Dumbledore was relyin on
us!''
``But youve just said there was no way you could go back!''
``Not by daylight we couldn, no. We just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o days lyin low
up in the cave an watchin. An wha we saw wasn good.''
``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) rip off more heads?'' asked Hermione, sounding squeamish.
``No,'' said Hagrid, ``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had.''
``What dyou mean?''
``I mean we soon found out he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) didn object ter all wizards - just us.''
``Death Eaters?'' said Harry quickly.
``Yep,'' said Hagrid darkly. ``Couple of em were visitin him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) evry day, bringin gifts ter the
Gurg, an he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wasn dangling them upside-down.''
``How dyou know they were Death Eaters?'' said Ron.
``Because I recognized one of em,'' Hagrid growled. ``Macnair, remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)? Bloke they sent
ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maniac</b></font>) is. Likes killin as much as Golgomath; no wonder they were
gettin on so well.''
``So Macnairs persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?'' said Hermione desperately.
``Hold yer Hippogriffs, I haven finished me story yet!'' said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. ``Me an Olympe talked it over an we agreed, jus cause the Gurg looked like favorin You-Know-Who didn mean all of em would. We had ter try an persuade some o the others, the ones who hadn wanted Golgomath as Gurg.''
``How could you tell which ones they were?'' asked Ron.
``Well, they were the ones bein beaten to a pulp, weren they?'' said Hagrid patiently. ``The ones
with any sense were keepin outta Golgomaths way, hidin out in caves roun the gully jus like
we were. So we decided wed go pokin round the caves by night an see if we couldn persuade
a few o them.''
``You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?'' said Ron, with awed respect in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
voice.
``Well, it wasn the giants who worried us most,'' said Hagrid. ``We were more concerned abou
the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us before we wen not ter tangle with em if we could
avoid it, an the trouble was they knew we was around -- spect Golgomath told em abou us.
At night, when the giants were sleepin an we wanted ter be creepin inter the caves, Macnair
an the other one were sneakin round the mountains lookin fer us. I was hard put to stop
Olympe jumpin out at em,'' said Hagrid, the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wild beard, ``she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
was rarin ter attack em... she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)s somethin when she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)s roused, Olympe... fiery, yeh know...
spect its the French in her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)...''
Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thirty seconds of reminiscence before
clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat loudly.
``So, what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?''
``What? Oh... oh, yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed we crept outta
the cave wed bin hidin in an headed back down inter the gully, keepin our eyes skinned fer
the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o the caves, no go - then, in abou the sixth one, we found
three giants hidin.''
``Cave mustve been cramped,'' said Ron.
``Wasn room ter swing a Kneazle,'' said Hagrid.
``Didnt they attack you when they saw you?'' asked Hermione.
``Probably woulda done if theyd bin in any condition,'' said Hagrid, ``but they was badly hurt, all
three o them; Golgomaths lot had beaten em unconscious; theyd woken up an crawled inter
the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o them had a bit of English an e translated fer
the others, an what we had ter say didn seem ter go down too badly. So we kep goin back,
visitin the wounded... I reckon we had abou six or seven o them convinced at one poin.''
``Six or seven?'' said Ron eagerly. ``Well thats not bad - are they going to come over here and
start fighting You-Know-Who with us?''
But Hermione said, ``What do you mean one point, Hagrid?''
Hagrid looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sadly.
``Golgomaths lot raided the caves. The ones tha survived didn wan no more ter to do with us
after that.''
``So... so there arent any giants coming?'' said Ron, looking disappointed.
``Nope,'' said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) turned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) steak and applied the cooler side
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face, ``but we did wha we meant ter do, we g ave em Dumbledores message an some o
them heard it an I spect some o themll remember it. Jus maybe, them that don want ter stay
around Golgomathll move outta the mountains, an theres gotta be a chance theyll remember
Dumbledores friendly to em... could be theyll come.''
Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes were
soaked through: Fang was drooling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) head in Harrys lap.
``Hagrid?'' said Hermione quietly after a while.
``Mmm?''
``Did you... was there any sign of... did you hear anything about your... your... mother while
you were there?''
Hagrids unobscured eye rested upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and Hermione looked rather scared.
``Im sorry... I... forget it -''
``Dead,'' Hagrid grunted. ``Died years ago. They told me.''
``Oh... Im... Im really sorry'' said Hermione in a very small voice. Hagrid shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) massive shoulders.
``No need,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) said shortly. ``Cant remember her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) much. Wasn a great mother.''
They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to
speak.
``But you still havent explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,'' Ron said, gesturing towards
Hagrids bloodstained face.
``Or why youre back so late,'' said Harry. ``Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago -''
``Who attacked you?'' said Ron.
``I haven bin attacked!'' said Hagrid emphatically. ``I -''
But the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione
gasped; her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mug slipped through her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of
them stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled
across the thin curtain.
``Its her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!'' Ron whispered.
``Get under here!'' Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whirled it over himself
and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived under the Cloak as well. Huddled
together, they backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Hagrid looked
thoroughly confused.
``Hagrid, hide our mugs!''
Hagrid seized Harry and Rons mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fangs basket. Fang
was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) out of the way with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) foot and pulled it
open.
Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) green tweed cloak and a matching
hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) leaned back so as to see Hagrids face; she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) barely reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
navel.
``So,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. ``Youre Hagrid, are
you?''
Without waiting for an answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) strolled into the room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) bulging eyes rolling in every
direction.
``Get away,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) snapped, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) and was
attempting to lick her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) face.
``Er - I don want ter be rude,'' said Hagrid, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), ``but who the ruddy hell are you?''
``My name is Dolores Umbridge.''
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood,
sandwiched between Ron and Hermione.
``Dolores Umbridge?'' Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. ``I thought you were one o
them Ministry - don you work with Fudge?''
``I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,'' said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin,
taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling
cloak. ``I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher -''
``Thas brave of yeh,'' said Hagrid, ``theres not manyd take tha job any more.<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>the Arts teacher</b></font>)</div>- and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,'' said Umbridge, giving no sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>).
``Whas that?'' said Hagrid, frowning.
``Precisely what I was going to ask,'' said Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermiones mug.
``Oh,'' said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance towards the corner where Harry, Ron and
Hermione stood hidden, ``oh, tha was... was Fang. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) broke a mug. So I had ter use this one
instead.''
Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been drinking, one hand still clamped over the
dragon steak pressed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye. Umbridge stood facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) now, taking in every detail of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
appearance instead of the cabins.
``I heard voices,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said quietly.
``I was talkin ter Fang,'' said Hagrid stoutly.
``And was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) talking back to you?''
``Well... in a manner o speakin,'' said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable. ``I sometimes say Fangs
near enough human -''
``There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,'' said
Umbridge sleekly.
Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) mouth. Luckily, Fang was sniffing loudly
around the hem of Professor Umbridges robes and she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) did not appear to have heard.
``Well, I ony jus got back,'' said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack. ``Maybe
someone came ter call earlier an I missed em.''
``There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.''
``Well, I... I don know why thatd be...'' said Hagrid, tugging nervously at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) beard and again
glancing towards the corner where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood, as though asking for help.
``Erm...''
Umbridge wheeled round and strode the length of the cabin, looking around carefully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) bent
and peered under the bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) opened Hagrids cupboards. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) passed within two inches of
where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry actually pulled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
stomach as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) walked by. After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for
cooking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wheeled round again and said, ``What has happened to you? How did you sustain
those injuries?''
Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, which in Harrys opinion was a mistake,
because the black and purple bruising all around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye was now clearly visible, not to mention
the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face. ``Oh, I... had a bit of an accident,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
said lamely.
``What sort of accident?''
``I - I tripped.''
``You tripped,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) repeated coolly.
``Yeah, thas right. Over... over a friends broomstick. I don fly, meself. Well, look at the size o
me, I don reckon theres a broomstick thatd hold me. Friend o mine breeds Abraxan horses, I
dunno if youve ever seen em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, Ive had a bit of a ride on one o
them an it was -''
``Where have you been?'' asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through Hagrids babbling.
``Whereve I -?''
``Been, yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said. ``Term started two months ago. Another teacher has had to cover your
classes. None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your
whereabouts. You left no address. Where have you been?''
There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) newly uncovered eye. Harry could
almost hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain working furiously.
``I - Ive been away for me health,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
``For your health,'' repeated Professor Umbridge. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) eyes traveled over Hagrids discolored
and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently and silently on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) waistcoat. ``I see.''
``Yeah,'' said Hagrid, ``bit o - o fresh air, yeh know -''
``Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,'' said Umbridge sweetly. The
small patch of Hagrids face that was not black or purple, flushed.
``Well -- change o scene, yeh know -''
``Mountain scenery?'' said Umbridge swiftly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) knows, Harry thought desperately.
``Mountains?'' Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. ``Nope, South o France fer me. Bit o sun
an... an sea.''
``Really?'' said Umbridge. ``You dont have much of a tan.''
``Yeah... well... sensitive skin,'' said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile. Harry noticed that
two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) teeth had been knocked out. Umbridge looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) coldly; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) smile faltered. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hoisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) handbag a little higher into the crook of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) arm and said, ``I shall, of course, be
informing the Minister of your late return.''
``Righ,'' said Hagrid, nodding.
``You ought to know, too, that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to
inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) turned sharply and marched back to the door.
``Youre inspectin us?'' Hagrid repeated blankly, looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
``Oh, yes,'' said Umbridge softly, looking back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hand on the door handle. ``The
Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Goodnight.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) left, closing the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) with a snap. Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak
but Hermione seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrist.
``Not yet,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) breathed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ear. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) might not be gone yet.''
Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stumped across the room and pulled back the
curtain an inch or so.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)s goin back ter the castle,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said in a low voice. ``Blimey... inspectin people, is she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)?''
``Yeah,'' said Harry, pulling off the Cloak. ``Trelawneys on probation already...''
``Um... what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid?'' asked Hermione.
``Oh, don you worry abou that, Ive got a great load o lessons planned,'' said Hagrid
enthusiastically, scooping up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye again.
``Ive bin keepin a couple o creatures saved fer yer OWL year; you wait, theyre somethin
really special.''
``Erm... special in what way?'' asked Hermione tentatively.
``Im not sayin,'' said Hagrid happily. ``I don wan t ter spoil the surprise.''
``Look, Hagrid,'' said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretence, ``Professor Umbridge wont be at all happy if you bring anything to class thats too dangerous.''
``Dangerous?'' said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. ``Don be silly, I wouldn give yeh anythin dangerous! I mean, all righ, they can look after themselves -''
``Hagrid, youve got to pass Umbridges inspection, and to do that it would really be better if she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
saw you teaching us how to look after Porlocks, how to tell the difference between Knarls and
hedgehogs, stuff like that!'' said Hermione earnestly.
``But thas not very interestin, Hermione,'' said Hagrid. ``The stuff Ive gots much more
impressive. Ive bin bringin em on fer years, I reckon Ive got the ony domestic herd in
Britain.''
``Hagrid... please...'' said Hermione, a note of real desperation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) voice. ``Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull thats bound to come up in our OWL.''
But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing towards the vast bed in
the corner.
``Lisen, its bin a long day an its late,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, patting Hermione gently on the shoulder, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud. ``Oh - sorry -'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) back up by the
neck of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) robes. ``Look, don you go worryin abou me, I promise yeh Ive got really good
stuff planned fer yer lessons now Im back... now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an
don forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!''
``I dunno if you got through to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),'' said Ron a sho rt while later when, having checked that the
coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace
behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went.
``Then Ill go back again tomorrow,'' said Hermione determinedly. ``Ill plan his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lessons for him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) if I have to. I dont care if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) throws out Trelawney but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)s not getting rid of Hagrid!''
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
The Eye of the Snake
Hermione ploughed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) way back to Hagrids cabin through two feet of snow on Sunday
morning. Harry and Ron wanted to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), but their mountain of homework had reached an
alarming height again, so they remained grudgingly in the common room, trying to ignore the
gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying themselves
skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing and, worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to
Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.
``Oy!'' bellowed Ron, finally losing patience and sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head out of the window, ``I am a
prefect and if one more snowball hits this window - OUCH!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head sharply, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face covered in snow.
``Its Fred and George,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said bitterly, slamming the window behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). ``Gits...''
Hermione returned from Hagrids just before lunch, shivering slightly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) robes damp to the
knees.
``So?'' said Ron, looking up when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) entered. ``Got all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lessons planned for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)?''
``Well, I tried,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pulled out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand and
gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) then pointed this at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) robes, which began to steam as they dried out. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wasnt even there when I arrived, I was
knocking for at least half an hour. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) came stumping out of the Forest -''
Harry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get
Hagrid the sack. ``Whats he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) keeping in there? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) say?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked.
``No,'' said Hermione miserably. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wants them to be a surprise. I tried to explain about
Umbridge, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) just doesnt get it. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather
study Knarls than Chimaeras - oh, I dont think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)s got a Chimaera,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) added at the appalled
look on Harry and Rons faces, ``but thats not for lack of trying, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said about how
hard it is to get eggs. I dont know how many times I told him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)d be better off following
Grubbly-Planks plan, I honestly dont think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) listened to half of what I said. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)s in a bit of a
funny mood, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) still wont say how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) got all those injuries.''
Hagrids reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from
all students. Some, like Fred, George and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle
between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrids enormous hand; others, like
Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads. Harry knew that many of
them preferred Professor Grubbly-Planks lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small,
unbiased part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Planks idea of an interesting
class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off.
It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron and Hermione headed down to
Hagrids on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold. Harry was worried, not only about what
Hagrid might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the class, particularly
Malfoy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) cronies, would behave if Umbridge was watching them.
However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow
towards Hagrid, who stood waiting for them on the edge of the Forest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) did not present a
reassuring sight; the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green
and yellow and some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) cuts still seemed to be bleeding. Harry could not understand this: had
Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted
from healing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was carrying what looked like
half a dead cow over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder.
``Were workin in here today!'' Hagrid called happily to the approaching students, jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
head back at the dark trees behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Bit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark.''
``What prefers the dark?'' Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice. ``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) say prefers the dark - did you hear?''
Harry remembered the only other occasion on which Malfoy had entered the Forest before now;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had not been very brave then, either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything
that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>).
``Ready?'' said Hagrid cheerfully, looking around at the class. ``Right, well, Ive bin savin a trip
inter the Forest fer yer fifth year. Thought wed go an see these creatures in their natural habitat.
Now, what were studyin today is pretty rare, I reckon Im probably the ony person in Britain
whos managed ter train em.''
``And youre sure theyre trained, are you?'' said Malfoy, the panic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) voice even more
pronounced. ``Only it wouldnt be the first time youd brought wild stuff to class, would it?''
The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought
Malfoy had a fair point, too.
``Course theyre trained,'' said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
shoulder.
``So what happened to your face, then?'' demanded Malfoy.
``Mind yer own business!'' said Hagrid, angrily. ``Now, if yehve finished askin stupid questions,
follow me!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) turned and strode straight into the Forest. Nobody seemed much disposed to follow. Harry
glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid,
leading the rest of the class.
They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely
together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground. With a grunt,
Hagrid deposited his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) half a cow on the ground, stepped back and turned to face his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) class, most of
whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), peering around nervously as though
expecting to be set upon at any moment.
``Gather roun, gather roun,'' Hagrid encouraged. ``Now, theyll be attracted by the smell o the
meat but Im goin ter give em a call anyway, cause theyll like ter know its me.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shaggy head to get the hair out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face and gave an odd, shrieking cry
that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed: most of
them looked too scared to make a sound.
Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the class continued to peer
nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was
coming. And then, as Hagrid shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair back for a third time and expanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enormous
chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.
A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later
the dragonish face, neck and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the
darkness. It surveyed the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its
head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs.
A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not imagined these
creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew about them too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron
was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) whispered, ``Why doesnt Hagrid call again?''
Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as
Rons and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them. There were
only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just
behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face; and
Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail.
``Oh, an here comes another one!'' said Hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of
the dark trees, folded its leathery wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the
meat. ``Now... put yer hands up, who can see em?''
Immensely pleased to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses,
Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand. Hagrid nodded at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Yeah... yeah, I knew youd be able ter, Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said seriously. ``An you too, Neville, eh? An -''
``Excuse me,'' said Malfoy in a sneering voice, ``but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?''
For an answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The whole class stared at it for a
few seconds, then several people gasped and Parvati squealed. Harry understood why: bits of
flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd
indeed.
``Whats doing it?'' Parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating behind the nearest tree.
``Whats eating it?''
``Thestrals,'' said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft ``Oh!'' of comprehension at Harrys
shoulder. ``Hogwarts has got a whole herd of em in here. Now, who knows -?''
``But theyre really, really unlucky!'' interrupted Parvati, looking alarmed. ``Theyre supposed to
bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them. Professor Trelawney told me once
-''
``No, no, no,'' said Hagrid, chuckling, ``thas jus superstition, that is, they aren unlucky, theyre
dead clever an useful! Course, this lot don get a lot o work, its mainly jus pullin the school
carriages unless Dumbledores takin a long journey an don want ter Apparate - an heres
another couple, look -''
Two more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of them passing very close to Parvati, who
shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree, saying, ``I think I felt something, I think its near
me!''
``Don worry, it won hurt yen,'' said Hagrid patiently. ``Righ, now, who can tell me why some o yeh can see em an some cant?''
Hermione raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand.
``Go on then,'' said Hagrid, beaming at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
``The only people who can see Thestrals,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, ``are people who have seen death.''
``Thas exactly right,'' said Hagrid solemnly, ``ten points ter Gryffindor. Now, Thestrals -''
``Hem, hem.''
Professor Umbridge had arrived. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was standing a few feet away from Harry, wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
green hat and cloak again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard at the ready. Hagrid, who had never heard Umbridges
fake cough before, was gazing in some concern at the closest Thestral, evidently under the
impression that it had made the sound.
``Hem, hem.''
``Oh, hello!'' Hagrid said, smiling, having located the source of the noise.
``You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning?'' said Umbridge, in the same loud, slow voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had used with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) earlier, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) were addressing somebody both foreign and very slow. ``Telling you that I would be inspecting y our lesson?''
``Oh, yeah,'' said Hagrid brightly. ``Glad yeh found the place all righ! Well, as you can see - or, I
dunno - can you? Were doin Thestrals today -''
``Im sorry?'' said Professor Umbridge loudly, cupping her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hand around her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) ear and frowning.
``What did you say?''
Hagrid looked a little confused.
``Er - Thestrals!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said loudly. ``Big - er - winged horses, yeh know!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) flapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) gigantic arms hopefully. Professor Umbridge raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) eyebrows at him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) and
muttered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) made a note on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard: ``Has... to... resort... to... crude...
sign... language.''
``Well... anyway...'' said Hagrid, turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered, ``erm...
what was I sayin?''
``Appears... to... have... poor... short... term... memory,'' muttered Umbridge, loudly enough
for everyone to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). Draco Malfoy looked as though Christmas had come a month early;
Hermione, on the other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage.
``Oh, yeah,'' said Hagrid, throwing an uneasy glance at Umbridges clipboard, but ploughing on
valiantly. ``Yeah, I was gonna tell yeh how come we got a herd. Yeah, so, we started off with a
male an five females. This one,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) patted the fir st horse to have appeared, ``name o Tenebrus,
he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>)s my special favorite, firs one born here in the Forest -''
``Are you aware,'' Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), ``that the Ministry of Magic has
classified Thestrals as dangerous?''
Harrys heart sank like a stone, but Hagrid merely chuckled.
``Thestrals aren dangerous! All righ, they might take a bite outta yeh if yeh really annoy them -''
``Shows... signs... of... pleasure... at... idea... of... violence,'' muttered Umbridge, scribbling
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard again.
``No - come on!'' said Hagrid, looking a little anxious now. ``I mean, a dogll bite if yeh bait it,
won it - but Thestrals have jus got a bad reputation because o the death thing - people used ter
think they were bad omens, didn they? Jus didn understand, did they?''
Umbridge did not answer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) finished writing her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) last note, then looked up at Hagrid and said,
again very loudly and slowly, ``Please continue teaching as usual. I am going to walk,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
mimed walking -LRB-Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter-RRB- ``among the
students'' -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) pointed around at individual members of the class-RRB- ``and ask them questions.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
pointed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) mouth to indicate talking.
Hagrid stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), clearly at a complete loss to understand why she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was acting as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
did not understand normal English. Hermione had tears of fury in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes now.
``You hag, you evil hag!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) whispered, as Umbridge walked towards Pansy Parkinson. ``I know
what youre doing, you awful, twisted, vicious -''
``Erm... anyway,'' said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the flow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Parkinson</b></font>) lesson, ``so - Thestrals.
Yeah. Well, theres loads o good stuff abou them...''
``Do you find,'' said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy Parkinson, ``that you are able
to understand Professor Hagrid when he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) talks?''
Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) eyes, but these were tears of laughter; indeed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
answer was almost incoherent because she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was trying to suppress her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) giggles.
``No... because... well... it sounds... like grunting a lot of the time.''
Umbridge scribbled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard. The few unbruised bits of Hagrids face flushed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Parkinson</b></font>)
tried to act as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Parkinson</b></font>) had not heard Pansys answer.
``Er... yeah... good stuff abou Thestrals. Well, once theyre tamed, like this lot, yehll never be
lost again. Mazin sense o direction, jus tell em where yeh want ter go -''
``Assuming they can understand you, of course,'' said Malfoy loudly, and Pansy Parkinson
collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles. Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then
turned to Neville.
``You can see the Thestrals, Longbottom, can you?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said.
Neville nodded.
``Who did you see die?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) asked, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) tone indifferent.
``My... my grandad,'' said Neville.
``And what do you think of them?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) stubby hand at the horses, who by now
had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone.
``Erm,'' said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid. ``Well, theyre... er... okay...''
``Students... are... too... intimidated... to... admit... they... are... frightened,'' muttered
Umbridge, making another note on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard.
``No!'' said Neville, looking upset. ``No, Im not scared of them!''
``Its quite all right,'' said Umbridge, patting Neville on the shoulder with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) evidently
intended to be an understanding smile, though it looked more like a leer to Harry. ``Well, Hagrid,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) turned to look up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice, ``I think Ive got enough to be getting along with. You will receive'' -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) mimed taking something from the air in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)-RRB- ``the results of your inspection'' -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) pointed at the clipboard-RRB- ``in ten days time.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) held up ten stubby little fingers, then, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) green hat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) bustled from their midst, leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits of laughter, Hermione actually shaking with fury and Neville looking confused and upset.
``That foul, lying, twisting old gargoyle!'' stormed Hermione half an hour later, as they made their way back up to the castle through the channels they had made earlier in the snow. ``You see what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)s up to? Its her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thing about half-breeds all over again - she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)s trying to make out Hagrids some kind of dimwitted troll, just because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had a giantess for a mother - and oh, its not fair, that really wasnt a bad lesson at all - I mean, all right, if it had been Blast-Ended Skrewts again, but Thestrals are fine - in fact, for Hagrid, theyre really good!''
``Umbridge said theyre dangerous,'' said Ron.
``Well, its like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,'' said Hermione impatiently, ``and I
suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldnt usually show them to us before NEWT level, but,
well, they are very interesting, arent they? The way some people can see them and some cant! I
wish I could.''
``Do you?'' Harry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) quietly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked suddenly horrorstruck.
``Oh, Harry - Im sorry - no, of course I dont - that was a really stupid thing to say.''
``Its okay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said quickly, ``dont worry''
``Im surprised so many people could see them,'' said Ron. ``Three in a class -''
``Yeah, Weasley, we were just wondering,'' said a malicious voice. Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle were walking along right behind them. ``Dyou reckon if you saw someone snuff it youd be able to see the Quaffle better?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>), Crabbe and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle, then
broke into a chorus of ``Weasley is our King''. Rons ears turned scarlet.
``Ignore them, just ignore them,'' intoned Hermione, pulling out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand and performing the
charm to produce hot air again, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could melt them an easier path through the untouched
snow between them and the greenhouses.
December arrived, bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the
fifth-years. Ron and Hermiones prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas
approached. They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle -LRB-``You try putting up
tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it,'' said Ron-RRB-, to
watch over first- and second-years spending their break-times inside because of the bitter cold
-LRB-``And theyre cheeky little snot-rags, you know, we definitely werent that rude when we were in first year,'' said Ron-RRB- and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels -LRB-``He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)s got dung for brains, that one,'' said Ron furiously-RRB-. They were so busy that Hermione had even stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) last three.
``All those poor elves I havent set free yet, having to stay here over Christmas because there
arent enough hats!''
Harry, who had not had the heart to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) that Dobby was taking everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) made, bent
lower over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) History of Magic essay. In any case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not want to think about Christmas. For
the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) school career, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very much wanted to spend the holidays away from
Hogwarts. Between his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be
put on probation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment. The only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
really looked forward to were the D.A. meetings, and they would have to stop over the holidays,
as nearly everybody in the D.A. would be spending the time with their families. Hermione was
going skiing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never heard of
Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains. Ron was
going home to The Burrow. Harry endured several days of envy before Ron said, in response to
Harry asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was going to get home for Christmas: ``But youre coming too! Didnt I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago!''
Hermione rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes, but Harrys spirits soared: the thought of Christmas at The Burrow
was truly wonderful, though slightly marred by Harrys guilty feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would not be able
to spend the holiday with Sirius. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could possibly persuade Mrs. Weasley
to invite his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) godfather for the festivities. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) doubted whether Dumbledore would
permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could not help but think Mrs. Weasley might
not want him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>); they were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on constant watch it
would be unwise to attempt to contact him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not like to think of Sirius alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) mothers
old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.
Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D.A. meeting before the holidays andwas very glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had, because when the lamps burst into light he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw that Dobby had taken it
upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could tell the elf had done it, because
nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a
picture of Harrys face and bearing the legend: HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!
Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna
Love good entered, looking as dreamy as always.
``Hello,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the decorations. ``These are nice,
did you put them up?''
``No,'' said Harry, ``it was Dobby the house-elf.''
``Mistletoe,'' said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over
Harrys head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jumped out from under it. ``Good thinking,'' said Luna very seriously. ``Its often infested with Nargles.''
Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles were by the arrival of Angelina, Katie and
Alicia. All three of them were breathless and looked very cold.
``Well,'' said Angelina dully, pulling off her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) cloak and throwing it into a corner, ``weve finally
replaced you.''
``Replaced me?'' said Harry blankly.
``You and Fred and George,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) said impatiently. ``Weve got another Seeker!''
``Who?'' said Harry quickly.
``Ginny Weasley,'' said Katie.
Harry gaped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>).
``Yeah, I know,'' said Angelina, pulling out her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) wand and flexing her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) arm, ``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)s pretty good,
actually. Nothing on you, of course,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) said, throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a very dirty look, ``but as we cant
have you...''
Harry bit back the retort he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was longing to utter: did she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) imagine for a second that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not
regret his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) did?
``And what about the Beaters?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked, trying to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice even.
``Andrew Kirke,'' said Alicia without enthusiasm, ``and Jack Sloper. Neither of them are brilliant,
but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up...''
The arrival of Ron, Hermione and Neville brought this depressing discussion to an end, and
within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent Harry seeing Angelinas burning,
reproachful looks.
``Okay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, calling them all to order. ``I thought this evening we should just go over the things weve done so far, because its the last meeting before the holidays and theres no point starting anything new right before a three-week break -''
``Were not doing anything new?'' said Zacharias Smith, in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to
carry through the room. ``If Id known that, I wouldnt have come.''
``Were all really sorry Harry didnt tell you, then,<div class="bookquote">'' said Fred loudly.
Several people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) stomach, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had missed a step going downstairs.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>- we can practice in pairs,'' said Harry. ``Well start with the Impediment Jinx, for ten minutes,
then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again.''
They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual. The room was soon full of
intermittent cries of ``Impedimenta!'' People froze f or a minute or so, during which their partner
would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and
take their turn at the jinx.
Neville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when Harry had unfrozen three
times in a row, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had Neville join Ron and Hermione again so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) could walk around the
room and watch the others. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) passed Cho she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) beamed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) resisted the temptation
to walk past her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) several more times.
After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions all over the floor and started
practicing Stunning again. Space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at
once; half the group observed the others for a while, then swapped over.
Harry felt himself positively swelling with pride as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watched them all. True, Neville did Stun
Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had been aiming, but it was a much closer miss than
usual, and everybody else had made enormous progress.
At the end of an hour, Harry called a halt.
``Youre getting really good,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, beaming around at them. ``When we get back from the
holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff - maybe even Patronuses.''
There was a murmur of excitement. The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes; most
people wished Harry a ``Happy Christmas'' as they went. Feeling cheerful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) collected up the
cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away. Ron and Hermione left before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) did; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) was hoping to receive a ``Merry
Christmas'' from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
``No, you go on,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) friend Marietta and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) heart gave a jolt that seemed to
take it into the region of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) Adams apple.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) was quite sure they were alone now and
waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) to speak. Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) heard a hearty sniff.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face.
``Wha--?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) didnt know what to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was simply standing there, crying silently.
``Whats up?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) said, feebly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head and wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sleeve.
``Im - sorry,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said thickly. ``I suppose... its just... learning all this stuff... it just makes me... wonder whether... if he (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>)d known it all... he (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>)d still be alive.''
Harrys heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) navel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
ought to have known. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wanted to talk about Cedric.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) did know this stuff,'' Harry said heavily. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) was really good at it, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) could never have got to the middle of that maze. But if Voldemort really wants to kill you, you dont stand a chance.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hiccoughed at the sound of Voldemorts name, but stared at Harry without flinching.
``You survived when you were just a baby,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said quietly.
``Yeah, well,'' said Harry wearily, moving towards the door, ``I dunno why nor does anyone else,
so its nothing to be proud of.''
``Oh, dont go!'' said Cho, sounding tearful again. ``Im really sorry to get all upset like this... I
didnt mean to...''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hiccoughed again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was very pretty even when her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes were red and puffy. Harry felt
thoroughly miserable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d have been so pleased with just a ``Merry Christmas''.
``I know it must be horrible for you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, mop ping her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sleeve again. ``Me
mentioning Cedric, when you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) die... I suppose you just want to forget about it?''
Harry did not say anything to this; it was quite true, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt heartless saying it.
``Youre a r-really good teacher, you know,'' said Cho, with a watery smile. ``Ive never been able
to Stun anything before.''
``Thanks,'' said Harry awkwardly.
They looked at each other for a long moment. Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room
and, at the same time, a complete inability to move his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet.
``Mistletoe,'' said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) head.
``Yeah,'' said Harry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth was very dry. ``Its probably full of Nargles, though.''
``What are Nargles?''
``No idea,'' said Harry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had moved closer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain seemed to have been Stunned. ``Youd
have to ask Loony. Luna, I mean.''
Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was even nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) now.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) could have counted the freckles on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) nose.
``I really like you, Harry.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) could not think. A tingling sensation was spreading through him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>), paralysing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) arms, legs
and brain.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was much too close. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) could see every tear clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyelashes...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) returned to the common room half an hour later to find Hermione and Ron in the best seats
by the fire; nearly everybody else had gone to bed. Hermione was writing a very long letter; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
had already filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the edge of the table. Ron
was lying on the hearthrug, trying to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) Transfiguration homework.
``What kept you?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) asked, as Harry sank into the armchair next to Hermiones.
Harry didnt answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in a state of shock. Half of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to tell Ron and Hermione
what had just happened, but the other half wanted to take the secret with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) to the grave.
``Are you all right, Harry?'' Hermione asked, peering at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) over the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) quill.
Harry gave a half-hearted shrug. In truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didnt know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was all right or not.
``Whats up?'' said Ron, hoisting himself up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) elbow to get a clearer view of Harry. ``Whats
happened?''
Harry didnt quite know how to set about telling them, and still wasnt sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted
to. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had decided not to say anything, Hermione took matters out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands.
``Is it Cho?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) asked in a businesslike way. ``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) corner you after the meeting?''
Numbly surprised, Harry nodded. Ron sniggered, breaking off when Hermione caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye.
``So - er - what did she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) want?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked in a mock casual voice.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) -'' Harry began, rather hoarsely; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat and tried again. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) - er -''
``Did you kiss?'' asked Hermione briskly.
Ron sat up so fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ink bottle flying all over the rug. Disregarding this completely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
stared avidly at Harry.
``Well?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) demanded.
Harry looked from Rons expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermiones slight
frown, and nodded.
``HA!''
Ron made a triumphant gesture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made
several timid-looking second-years over beside the window jump. A reluctant grin spread over
Harrys face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug.
Hermione gave Ron a look of deep disgust and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) letter.
``Well?'' Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. ``How was it?''
Harry considered for a moment.
``Wet,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said truthfully.
Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust, it was hard to tell.
``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was crying,'' Harry continued heavily.
``Oh,'' said Ron, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) smile fading slightly. ``Are you that bad at kissing?''
``Dunno,'' said Harry, who hadnt considered this, and immediately felt rather worried. ``Maybe I
am.''
``Of course youre not,'' said Hermione absently, still scribbling away at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) letter.
``How do you know?'' said Ron very sharply.
``Because Cho spends half her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) time crying these days,'' said Hermione vaguely. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) does it at
mealtimes, in the loos, all over the place.''
``Youd think a bit of kissing would cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) up,'' said Ron, grinning.
``Ron,'' said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) quill into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) inkpot, ``you are
the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.''
``Whats that supposed to mean?'' said Ron indignantly. ``What sort of person cries while
someones kissing them?''
``Yeah,'' said Harry, slightly desperately, ``who does?''
Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face.
``Dont you understand how Chos feeling at the moment?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) asked.
``No,'' said Harry and Ron together.
Hermione sighed and laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) quill.
``Well, obviously, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. Then I expect she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s feeling
confused because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) liked Cedric and now she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) likes Harry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cant work out who she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
likes best. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)ll be feeling guilty, thinking its an insult to Cedrics memory to be kissing
Harry at all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) starts
going out with Harry. And she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) probably cant work out what her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feelings towards Harry are,
anyway, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so thats all very mixed
up and painful. Oh, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team
because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s been flying so badly.''
A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron said, ``One person cant feel
all that at once, theyd explode.''
``Just because youve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesnt mean we all have,'' said
Hermione nastily picking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) quill again.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was the one who started it,'' said Harry. ``I wouldntve - she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) just sort of came at me - and
next thing she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s crying all over me - I didnt know what to do --''
``Dont blame you, mate,'' said Ron, looking alarmed at the very thought.
``You just had to be nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),'' said Hermione, looking up anxiously. ``You were, werent you?''
``Well,'' said Harry, an unpleasant heat creeping up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, ``I sort of - patted her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) on the back a
bit.''
Hermione looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was restraining herself from rolling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes with extreme
difficulty.
``Well, I suppose it could have been worse,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said. ``Are you going to see her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) again?''
``Ill have to, wont I?'' said Harry. ``Weve got D.A. meetings, havent we?''
``You know what I mean,'' said Hermione impatiently.
Harry said nothing. Hermiones words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to imagine going somewhere with Cho -- Hogsmeade, perhaps - and being alone with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) for hours at a time. Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) would have been expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) out after what
had just happened... the thought made his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) stomach clench painfully.
``Oh well,'' said Hermione distantly, buried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) letter once more, ``youll have plenty of
opportunities to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''
``What if he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) doesnt want to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?'' said Ron, who had been watching Harry with an unusually
shrewd expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.
``Dont be silly,'' said Hermione vaguely, ``Harrys liked her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for ages, havent you, Harry?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not answer. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had imagined a scene
involving the two of them it had always featured a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to
a Cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) shoulder.
``Whore you writing the novel to, anyway?'' Ron asked Hermione, trying to read the bit of
parchment now trailing on the floor. Hermione hitched it up out of sight.
``Viktor.''
``Krum?''
``How many other Viktors do we know?''
Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled. They sat in silence for another twenty minutes, Ron
finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione
writing steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and sealing it, and Harry
staring into the fire, wishing more than anything that Siriuss head would appear there and give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) some advice about girls. But the fire merely crackled lower and lower, until the red-hot
embers crumbled into ash and, looking around, Harry saw that they were, yet again, the last ones
in the common room.
``Well, night,'' said Hermione, yawning widely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) set off up the girls staircase.
``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) see in Krum?'' Ron demanded, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and Harry climbed the boys stairs.
``Well,'' said Harry, considering the matter, ``I spose he (<font color='blue'><b>Krum</b></font>)s older, isnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Krum</b></font>)... and he (<font color='blue'><b>Krum</b></font>)s an
international Quidditch player...''
``Yeah, but apart from that,'' said Ron, sounding aggravated. ``I mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Krum</b></font>)s a grouchy git, isnt
he (<font color='blue'><b>Krum</b></font>)?''
``Bit grouchy, yeah,'' said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho.
They pulled off their robes and put on pajamass in silence; Dean, Seamus and Neville were
already asleep. Harry put his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the
hangings closed around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) four-poster; instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stared at the patch of starry sky visible
through the window next to Nevilles bed. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had known, this time last night, that in twenty-four hours time he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) would have kissed Cho Chang...
``Night,'' grunted Ron, from somewhere to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) right.
``Night,'' said Harry.
Maybe next time... if there was a next time... she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d be a bit happier. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ought to have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
out; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... or was she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lying in
bed, still crying about Cedric? He (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) did not know what to think. Hermiones explanation had made
it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand.
Thats what they should teach us here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) thought, turning over on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) side, how girls brains
work... itd be more useful than Divination, anyway...
Neville snuffled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) sleep. An owl hooted somewhere out in the night.
Harry dreamed he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was back in the D.A. room. Cho was accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) of luring her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) there under
false pretences; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog Cards if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
showed up. Harry protested... Cho shouted, ``Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog Cards,
look!'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pulled out fistfuls of Cards from in side her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) robes and threw them into the air.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) turned into Hermione, who said, ``You did promise her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), you know, Harry... I think
youd better give her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) something else instead... how about your Firebolt?'' And Harry was
protesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not give Cho his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Firebolt, because Umbridge had it, and anyway the
whole thing was ridiculous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d only come to the D.A. room to put up some Christmas baubles
shaped like Dobbys head...
The dream changed...
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body felt smooth, powerful and flexible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was gliding between shining metal bars, across
dark, cold stone... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was flat against the floor, sliding along on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) belly... it was dark, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could see objects around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shimmering in strange, vibrant colors... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
head... at first glance the corridor was empty... but no... a man was sitting on the floor ahead,
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chin drooping on to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chest, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outline gleaming in the dark...
Harry put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tongue... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tasted the mans scent on the air... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was alive but drowsy...
sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor...
Harry longed to bite the man... but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must master the impulse... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had more important work to
do...
But the man was stirring... a silver Cloak fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet; and Harry
saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vibrant, blurred outline towering above him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), saw a wand withdrawn from a belt... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
no choice... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fangs
deeply into the mans flesh, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ribs splinter beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jaws, feeling the warm gush of
blood...
The man was yelling in pain... then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell silent... he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slumped backwards against the wall...
blood was splattering on to the floor...
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead hurt terribly... it was aching fit to burst...
``Harry! HARRY!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes. Every inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body was covered in icy sweat; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed covers were
twisted all around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like a strait-jacket; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt as though a white-hot poker were being applied
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead.
``Harry!''
Ron was standing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looking extremely frightened. There were more figures at the foot of
Harrys bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands; the pain was blinding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rolled right over
and vomited over the edge of the mattress.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s really ill,'' said a scared voice. ``Should we call someone?''
``Harry!Harry!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to tell Ron, it was very important that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... taking great gulps of air, Harry
pushed himself up in bed, willing himself not to throw up again, the pain half-blinding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Your dad,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) panted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest heaving. ``Your dads... been attacked...''
``What?'' said Ron uncomprehendingly.
``Your dad! He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)s been bitten, its serious, there was blood everywhere...''
``Im going for help,'' said the same scared voice, and Harry heard footsteps running out of the
dormitory.
``Harry, mate,'' said Ron uncertainly, ``you... you were just dreaming...''
``No!'' said Harry furiously; it was crucial that Ron understand. ``It wasnt a dream... not an ordinary dream... I was there, I saw it... I did it...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care. The pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead was
subsiding slightly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was still sweating and shivering feverishly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) retched again and
Ron leapt backwards out of the way.
``Harry, youre not well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said shakily. ``Nevilles gone for help.''
``Im fine!'' Harry choked, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) p yjamas and shaking uncontrollably.
``Theres nothing wrong with me, its your dad youve got to worry about - we need to find out where he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) is - he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)s bleeding like mad - I was - it was a huge snake.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back into it; Dean and Seamus were still
whispering somewhere nearby. Whether one minute passed or ten, Harry did not know; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
simply sat there shaking, feeling the pain recede very slowly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar... then there were
hurried footsteps coming up the stairs and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Nevilles voice again.
``Over here, Professor.''
Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) tartan dressing gown, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) glasses
perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) bony nose.
``What is it, Potter? Where does it hurt?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had never been so pleased to see her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>); it was a member of the Order of the Phoenix he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) needed
now, not someone fussing over him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) and prescribing useless potions.
``Its Rons dad,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) said, sitting up again. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s been attacked by a snake and its serious, I saw it happen.''
``What do you mean, you saw it happen?'' said Professor McGonagall, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) dark eyebrows
contracting.
``I dont know... I was asleep and then I was there...''
``You mean you dreamed this?''
``No!'' said Harry angrily; would none of them understand? ``I was having a dream at first about
something completely different, something stupid... and then this interrupted it. It was real, I
didnt imagine it. Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was attacked by a gigantic snake,
there was a load of blood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) collapsed, someones got to find out where he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) is...''
Professor McGonagall was gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) lopsided spectacles as though horrified at
what she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) was seeing.
``Im not lying and Im not mad!'' Harry told her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice rising to a shout. ``I tell you, I saw it
happen!''
``I believe you, Potter,'' said Professor McGonagall curtly. ``Put on your dressing gown - were
going to see the Headmaster.''
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
St. Mungos Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries
Harry was so relieved she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seriously that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not hesitate, but jumped out of
bed at once, pulled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dressing gown and pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses back on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose.
``Weasley, you ought to come too,'' said Professor McGonagall.
They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of Neville, Dean and Seamus, out of
the dormitory, down the spiral stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole and off
along the Fat Ladys moonlit corridor. Harry felt as though the panic inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might spill over
at any moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to run, to yell for Dumbledore; Mr. Weasley was bleeding as they
walked along so sedately, and what if those fangs -LRB-Harry tried hard not to think my fangs-RRB- had
been poisonous? They passed Mrs Norris, who turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) lamplike eyes upon them and hissed
faintly, but Professor McGonagall said, ``Shoo!'' Mrs Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in
a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledores office.
``Fizzing Whizzbee,'' said Professor McGonagall.
The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone
staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped
on to the moving stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards
in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like
a griffin.
Though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room, a positive
babble of them. It sounded as though Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people.
Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly
as though someone had switched them all off. The door opened of its own accord and Professor
McGonagall led Harry and Ron inside.
The room was in half-darkness; the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and
still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did; the portraits of old
headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames. Behind the
door, a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its
wing.
``Oh, its you, Professor McGonagall... and... ah.''
Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) desk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) leaned forward into the pool
of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was wearing a magnificently
embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt, but seemed wideawake, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon Professor McGonagall.
``Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a... well, a nightmare,'' said Professor McGonagall. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
says...''
``It wasnt a nightmare,'' said Harry quickly.
Professor McGonagall looked round at Harry, frowning slightly.
``Very well, then, Potter, you tell the Headmaster about it.''
``I... well, I was asleep...'' said Harry and, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) terror and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) desperation to make
Dumbledore understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) felt slightly irritated that the Headmaster was not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>), but
examining his (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>) own interlocked fingers. ``But it wasnt an ordinary dream... it was real... I saw it
happen...'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>) took a deep breath, ``Rons dad - Mr. Weasley - has been attacked by a giant
snake.''
The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>) had said them, sounding slightly ridiculous,
even comic. There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the
ceiling. Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked.
``How did you see this?'' Dumbledore asked quietly, still not looking at Harry.
``Well... I dont know,'' said Harry, rather angrily - what did it matter? ``Inside my head, I suppose -''
``You misunderstand me,'' said Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone. ``I mean... can you
remember -- er - where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you
perhaps standing beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?''
This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore; it was almost as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
knew...
``I was the snake,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``I saw it all from the snakes point of view.''
Nobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking at Ron who was still wheyfaced, asked in a new and sharper voice, ``Is Arthur seriously injured?''
``Yes,'' said Harry emphatically - why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they not realize
how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side? And why could Dumbledore
not do him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) the courtesy of looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)?
But Dumbledore stood up, so quickly it made Harry jump, and addressed one of the old portraits
hanging very near the ceiling. ``Everard?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said sharply. ``And you too, Dilys!''
A sallow-faced wizard with a short black bangs and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in
the frame beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their
eyes immediately.
``You were listening?'' said Dumbledore.
The wizard nodded; the witch said, ``Naturally.''
``The man has red hair and glasses,'' said Dumbledore. ``Everard, you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Everard</b></font>) is found by the right people -''
Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of emerging in neighboring
pictures -LRB-as usually happened at Hogwarts-RRB- neither reappeared. One frame now contained
nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair. Harry noticed that
many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls, though snoring and drooling most
convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from under their eyelids, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) suddenly understood
who had been talking when they had knocked.
``Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwartss most celebrated Heads,'' Dumbledore said, now
sweeping around Harry, Ron and Professor McGonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping
bird on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) perch beside the door. ``Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other
important wizarding institutions. As they are free to move between their own portraits, they can
tell us what may be happening elsewhere...''
``But Mr. Weasley could be anywhere!'' said Harry.
``Please sit down, all three of you,'' said Dumbledore, as though Harry had not spoken, ``Everard
and Dilys may not be back for several minutes. Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up
extra chairs.''
Professor McGonagall pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) wand from the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) dressing gown and waved it; three
chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz
armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured up at Harrys hearing. Harry sat down, watching
Dumbledore over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder. Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkess plumed golden head
with one finger. The phoenix awoke immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) beautiful head high and
observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes.
``We will need,'' Dumbledore said very quietly to the bird, ``a warning.''
There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone.
Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry
had never known, carried it over to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) desk, sat down facing them again and tapped it gently
with the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand.
The instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises. Tiny puffs of pale green
smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) brow furrowed. After a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that
thickened and coiled in the air... a serpents head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth
wide. Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) story: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked eagerly at
Dumbledore for a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was right, but Dumbledore did not look up.
``Naturally, naturally,'' murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise. ``But in essence divided?''
Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The smoke serpent, however, split itself
instantly into two snakes, both coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim
satisfaction, Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand: the clinking
noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze and vanished.
Dumbledore replaced the instrument on its spindly little table. Harry saw many of the old
headmasters in the portraits follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with their eyes, then, realizing that Harry was watching
them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again. Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver
instrument was for, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their
right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Everard</b></font>) portrait, panting slightly.
``Dumbledore!''
``What news?'' said Dumbledore at once.
``I yelled until someone came running,'' said the wizard, who was mopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) brow on the
curtain behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), ``said Id heard something moving downstairs - they werent sure whether to
believe me but went down to check - you know there are no portraits down there to watch from.
Anyway, they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) up a few minutes later. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) doesnt look good, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s covered in blood, I
ran along to Elfrida Craggs portrait to get a good view as they left -''
``Good,'' said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement. ``I take it Dilys will have seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) arrive, then -''
And moments later, the silver-ringleted witch had reappeared in her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) picture, too; she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) sank,
coughing, into her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) armchair and said, ``Yes, theyve taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) to St. Mungos, Dumbledore...
they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) past my portrait... he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) looks bad...''
``Thank you,'' said Dumbledore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) looked round at Professor McGonagall.
``Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.''
``Of course...''
Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door. Harry cast a sideways glance at
Ron, who was looking terrified.
``And Dumbledore - what about Molly?'' said Professor McGonagall, pausing at the door.
``That will be a job for Fawkes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching,''
said Dumbledore. ``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) may already know... that excellent clock of hers...''
Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not the time, but the whereabouts
and conditions of the various Weasley family members, and with a pang he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) thought that Mr.
Weasleys hand must, even now, be pointing atmortal peril. But it was very late. Mrs. Weasley
was probably asleep, not watching the clock. Harry felt cold as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered Mrs. Weasleys
Boggart turning into Mr. Weasleys lifeless body, his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) glasses askew, blood running down his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
face... but Mr. Weasley wasnt going to die... he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) couldnt...
Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and Ron. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) emerged from it
carrying a blackened old kettle, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) placed carefully on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand and
murmured, ``Portus!'' For a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue light; then it
quivered to rest, as solidly black as ever.
Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed
beard, who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was
apparently sleeping so deeply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) could not hear Dumbledores voice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) attempted to
rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>).
``Phineas. Phineas.''
The subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep; they were
shifting around in their frames, the better to watch what was happening. When the clever-looking
wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) name, too.
``Phineas! Phineas! PHINEAS!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) could not pretend any longer; he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) gave a theatrical jerk and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) eyes wide.
``Did someone call?''
``I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,'' said Dumbledore. ``Ive got another
message.''
``Visit my other portrait?'' said Phineas in a reedy voice, giving a long, fake yawn -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) eyes
traveling around the room and focusing on Harry-RRB-. ``Oh, no, Dumbledore, I am too tired tonight.''
Something about Phineass voice was familiar to Harry, where had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard it before? But before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could think, the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest.
``Insubordination, sir!'' roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard, brandishing his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) fists. ``Dereliction of duty!''
``We are honor-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts!'' cried a fraillooking old wizard whom Harry recognized as Dumbledores predecessor, Armando Dippet.
``Shame on you, Phineas!''
``Shall I persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>), Dumbledore?'' called a gimlet-eyed witch, raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod.
``Oh, very well,'' said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing the wand with mild apprehension,
``though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) may well have destroyed my picture by now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s done away with most of the family
-''
``Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,'' said Dumbledore, and Harry realized immediately
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had heard Phineass voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
bedroom in Grimmauld Place. ``You are to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) the message that Arthur Weasley has been
gravely injured and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) wife, children and Harry Potter will be arriving at his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) house shortly.
Do you understand?''
``Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter coming to stay,'' repeated Phineas
in a bored voice. ``Yes, yes... very well.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the
study door opened again. Fred, George and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall,
all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked, still in their night things.
``Harry - whats going on?'' asked Ginny, who looked frightened. ``Professor McGonagall says
you saw Dad get hurt -''
``Your father has been injured in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) work for the Order of the Phoenix,'' said
Dumbledore, before Harry could speak. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been taken to St. Mungos Hospital for Magical
Maladies and Injuries. I am sending you back to Siriuss house, which is much more convenient
for the hospital than The Burrow. You will meet your mother there.''
``Howre we going?'' asked Fred, looking shaken. ``Floo powder?''
``No,'' said Dumbledore, ``Floo powder is not safe at the moment, the Network is being watched.
You will be taking a Portkey.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) desk. ``We are
just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back... I want to be sure that the coast is clear before
sending you -''
There was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office, leaving behind a single golden
feather that floated gently to the floor.
``It is Fawkess warning,'' said Dumbledore, catching the feather as it fell. ``Professor Umbridge
must know youre out of your beds... Minerva, go and head her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) off - tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) any story -''
Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)ll be delighted,'' said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas
had reappeared in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) Slytherin banner. ``My great-great-grandson has always had an odd
taste in house-guests.''
``Come here, then,'' Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. ``And quickly, before anyone
else joins us.''
Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledores desk.
``You have all used a Portkey before?'' asked Dumbledore, and they nodded, each reaching out to
touch some part of the blackened kettle. ``Good. On the count of three, then... one... two...''
It happened in a fraction of a second: in the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said ``three<div class="bookquote">'',
Harry looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) - they were very close together - and Dumbledores clear blue gaze
moved from the Portkey to Harrys face.
At once, Harrys scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again - and
unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt,
for that instant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would like nothing better than to strike - to bite - to sink his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fangs into the
man before him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) --
'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>... three.''
Harry felt a powerful jerk behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) navel, the ground vanished from beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand
was glued to the kettle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of
colors and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling them onwards... until his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet hit the ground so
hard his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground, and somewhere close at hand a voice
said:
``Back again, the blood-traitor brats. Is it true their fathers dying?''
``OUT!'' roared a second voice.
Harry scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet and looked around; they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen
of number twelve, Grimmauld Place. The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering
candle, which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper. Kreacher was disappearing through
the door to the hall, looking back at them malevolently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hitched up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loincloth; Sirius was
hurrying towards them all, looking anxious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was unshaven and still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) day clothes; there
was also a slightly Mundungus-like whiff of stale drink about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>).
``Whats going on?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny up. ``Phineas Nigellus said
Arthurs been badly injured --''
``Ask Harry,'' said Fred.
``Yeah, I want to hear this for myself,'' said George.
The twins and Ginny were staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Kreachers footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside.
``It was -'' Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore. ``I had a - a kind of - vision.''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told them all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) altered the story so that it sounded as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snakes own
eyes. Ron, who was still very white, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) a fleeting look, but did not speak. When Harry had
finished, Fred, George and Ginny continued to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for a moment. Harry did not know
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was imagining it or not, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fancied there was something accusatory in their looks.
Well, if they were going to blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) just for seeing the attack, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not told them
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been inside the snake at the time.
``Is Mum here?'' said Fred, turning to Sirius.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) probably doesnt even know whats happened yet,'' said Sirius. ``The important thing was to
get you away before Umbridge could interfere. I expect Dumbledores letting Molly know now.''
``Weve got to go to St. Mungos,'' said Ginny urgently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) looked around at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) brothers; they
were of course still in their pajamass. ``Sirius, can you lend us cloaks or anything?''
``Hang on, you cant go tearing off to St. Mungos!'' said Sirius.
``Course we can go to St. Mungos if we want,'' said Fred, with a mulish expression. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)s our
dad!''
``And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even
let his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wife know?''
``What does that matter?'' said George hotly.
``It matters because we dont want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of
things that are happening hundreds of miles away!'' said Sirius angrily. ``Have you any idea what
the Ministry would make of that information?''
Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the Ministry made of anything.
Ron was still ashen-faced and silent.
Ginny said, ``Somebody else could have told us... we could have heard it somewhere other than
Harry.''
``Like who?'' said Sirius impatiently. ``Listen, your dads been hurt while on duty for the Order
and the circumstances are fishy enough without his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) children knowing about it seconds after it
happened, you could seriously damage the Orders -''
``We dont care about the dumb Order!'' shouted Fred.
``Its our dad dying were talking about!'' yelled George.
``Your father knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was getting into and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wont thank you for messing things up for the
Order!'' said Sirius, equally angry. ``This is how it is - this is why youre not in the Order - you
dont understand - there are things worth dying for!''
``Easy for you to say, stuck here!'' bellowed Fred. ``I dont see you risking your neck!''
The little color remaining in Siriuss face drained from it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) looked for a moment as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
would quite like to hit Fred, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm.
``I know its hard, but weve all got to act as though we dont know anything yet. Weve got to
stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right?''
Fred and George still looked mutinous. Ginny, however, took a few steps over to the nearest
chair and sank into it. Harry looked at Ron, who made a funny movement somewhere between a
nod and a shrug, and they sat down too. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute, then took
seats either side of Ginny.
``Thats right,'' said Sirius encouragingly, ``come on, lets all... lets all have a drink while were
waiting. Accio Butterbeer!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the
pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the debris of Sinuss meal, and stopped neatly in front
of the six of them. They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of
the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table.
Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach was full of
horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not be here if it were not for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); they would all still be
asleep in bed. And it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ensured that
Mr. Weasley was found, because there was also the in escapable business of it being he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) who had
attacked Mr. Weasley in the first place.
Dont be stupid, you havent got fangs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) told himself, trying to keep calm, though the hand on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) Butterbeer bottle was shaking, you were lying in bed, you werent attacking anyone...
But then, what just happened in Dumbledores office? he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) asked himself. I felt like I wanted to
attack Dumbledore, too...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) put the bottle down a little harder than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) meant to, and it slopped over on to the table. No
one took any notice. Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them
and, as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table,
accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather.
``Fawkes!'' said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. ``Thats not Dumbledores writing - it
must be a message from your mother - here -''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) thrust the letter into Georges hand, who ripped it open and read aloud: ``Dad is still alive. I
am setting out for St. Mungos now. Stay where you are. I will send news as soon as I can. Mum.''
George looked around the table.
``Still alive...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said slowly. ``But that makes it sound...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Harry, too, as though Mr. Weasley was
hovering somewhere between life and death. Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mothers letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). Fred pulled the parchment
out of Georges hands and read it for himself, then looked up at Harry, who felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand shaking
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling.
If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not remember it. Sirius
suggested once, without any real conviction, that they all go to bed, but the Weasleys looks of
disgust were answer enough. They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching the candle
wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, occasionally raising a bottle to their lips, speaking
only to check the time, to wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure each other that if
there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Mrs. Weasley must long since have
arrived at St. Mungos.
Fred fell into a doze, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) head lolling sideways on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) shoulder. Ginny was curled like a cat on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) chair, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) eyes were open; Harry could see them reflecting the firelight. Ron was sitting
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell. Harry and Sirius
looked at each other every so often, intruders upon the family grief, waiting... waiting...
At ten past five in the morning by Rons watch, the kitchen door swung open and Mrs. Weasley
entered the kitchen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>), Fred, Ron
and Harry half rising from their chairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) gave a wan smile.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mungo</b></font>)s going to be all right,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) voice weak with tiredness. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mungo</b></font>)s sleeping. We can all
go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mungo</b></font>) later. Bills sitting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)s going to take the morning off work.''
Fred fell back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) chair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) face. George and Ginny got up, walked
swiftly over to their mother and hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) Butterbeer in one.
``Breakfast!'' said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) feet. ``Wheres that accursed house-elf? Kreacher! KREACHER!''
But Kreacher did not answer the summons.
``Oh, forget it, then,'' muttered Sirius, counting the people in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>). ``So, its breakfast for -
lets see - seven... bacon and eggs, I think, and some tea, and toast -''
Harry hurried over to the stove to help. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not want to intrude on the Weasleys happiness
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dreaded the moment when Mrs. Weasley would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to recount his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vision. However,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs. Weasley lifted them out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands and
pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) into a hug.
``I dont know what would have happened if it hadnt been for you, Harry,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said in a muffled
voice. ``They might not have found Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but
thanks to you he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s alive and Dumbledores been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur
being where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was, youve no idea what trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would have been in otherwise, look at poor
Sturgis...''
Harry could hardly bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) gratitude, but fortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) soon released him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to turn to Sirius and
thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) for looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) children through the night. Sirius said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was very pleased to
have been able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) as long as Mr. Weasley was in
hospital.
``Oh, Sirius, Im so grateful... they think he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)ll be there a little while and it would be wonderful to
be nearer... of course, that might mean were here for Christmas.''
``The more the merrier!'' said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that Mrs. Weasley beamed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast.
``Sirius,'' Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer. ``Can I have a quick word? Er -
now?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without preamble, Harry told his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) godfather
every detail of the vision he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had had, including the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) himself had been the snake who
had attacked Mr. Weasley.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) paused for breath, Sirius said, ``Did you tell Dumbledore this?''
``Yes,'' said Harry impatiently, ``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) didnt tell me what it meant. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) doesnt tell me
anything any more.''
``Im sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) would have told you if it was anything to worry about,'' said Sirius steadily.
``But thats not all,'' said Harry, in a voice only a little above a whisper. ``Sirius, I... I think Im
going mad. Back in Dumbledores office, just before we took the Portkey... for a couple of
seconds there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one - my scar really hurt when I was looking at
Dumbledore - Sirius, I wanted to attack him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could only see a sliver of Siriuss face; the rest was in darkness.
``It must have been the aftermath of the vision, thats all,'' said Sirius. ``You were still thinking of
the dream or whatever it was and -''
``It wasnt that,'' said Harry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) head, ``it was like something rose up inside me, like
theres a snake inside me.''
``You need to sleep,'' said Sirius firmly. ``Youre going to have breakfast, then go upstairs to bed,
and after lunch you can go and see Arthur with the others. Youre in shock, Harry; youre
blaming yourself for something you only witnessed, and its lucky you did witness it or Arthur
might have died. Just stop worrying.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving Harry standing alone in the dark.
Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went up to the bedroom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and
Ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer, but while Ron crawled into bed and was
asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the
bedstead, keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might become the serpent again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sleep and wake to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had attacked Ron, or
else slithered through the house after one of the others...
When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too. Their trunks arrived
from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St
Mungos. Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their
robes into jeans and sweatshirts. When Tonks and Mad-Eye turned up to escort them across
London, they greeted them gleefully, laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an
angle to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>bowler</b></font>) magical eye and assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>bowler</b></font>), truthfully, that Tonks, whose hair was short
and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the Underground.
Tonks was very interested in Harrys vision of the attack on Mr. Weasley, something Harry was
not remotely interested in discussing.
``There isnt any Seer blood in your family, is there?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) enquired curiously, as they sat side by
side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city.
``No,'' said Harry, thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted.
``No,'' said Tonks musingly, ``no, I suppose its not really prophecy youre doing, is it? I mean,
youre not seeing the future, youre seeing the present... its odd, isnt it? Useful, though...''
Harry didnt answer; fortunately, they got out at the next stop, a station in the very heart of
London, and in the bustle of leaving the train he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was able to allow Fred and George to get
between himself and Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) up the escalator,
Moody clunking along at the back of the group, his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck
in between the buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) coat, clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) wand. Harry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sensed the concealed
eye staring hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Trying to avoid any more questions about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dream, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked Mad-Eye
where St. Mungos was hidden.
``Not far from here,'' grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store-lined
street packed with Christmas shoppers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) pushed Harry a little ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and stumped along
just behind; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat. ``Wasnt easy to
find a good location for a hospital. Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldnt
have it underground like the Ministry - wouldnt be healthy. In the end they managed to get hold
of a building up here. Theory was, sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the
crowd.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seized Harrys shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly
intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets.
``Here we go,'' said Moody a moment later.
They had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red-brick department store called Purge &
Dowse Ltd.. The place had a shabby, miserable air; the window displays consisted of a few
chipped dummies with their wigs askew, standing at random and modelling fashions at least ten
years out of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read: ``Closed for Refurbishment''. Harry
distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friend as they passed,
``Itsnever open, that place...''
``Right,'' said Tonks, beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly
ugly female dummy. Its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon
pinafore dress. ``Everybody ready?''
They nodded, clustering around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder
blades to urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly
dummy, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breath steaming up the glass. ``Wotcher... Were here to see Arthur
Weasley.''
Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) talking so quietly
through a sheet of glass, with buses rumbling along behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and all the racket of a street full
of shoppers. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reminded himself that dummies couldnt hear anyway. Next second, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger, and
Tonks had seized Ginny and Mrs. Weasley by the elbows, stepped right through the glass and
vanished.
Fred, George and Ron stepped after them. Harry glanced around at the jostling crowd; not one of
them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of Purge & Dowse
Ltd; nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in
front of them.
``Cmon,'' growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the back, and together they stepped
forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other
side.
There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had stood. They were in what
seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety
wooden chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies of WitchWeekly,
others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of
their chests. The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients
were making very peculiar noises: a sweaty-faced witch in the center of the front row, who was
fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched
whistle as steam came pouring out of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) mouth; a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged
like a bell every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) moved and, with each clang, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) head vibrated horribly so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) had to
seize himself by the ears to hold it steady.
Witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and down the rows, asking questions
and making notes on clipboards like Umbridges. Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on
their chests: a wand and bone, crossed.
``Are they doctors?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked Ron quietly.
``Doctors?'' said Ron, looking startled. ``Those Muggle nutters that cut people up? Nah, theyre
Healers.''
``Over here!'' called Mrs. Weasley above the renewed c langing of the warlock in the corner, and
they followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked Enquiries. The wall behind her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) was covered in notices and posters saying things like: A
CLEAN CAULDRON KEEPS POTIONS FROM BECOMING POISONS and ANTIDOTES
ARE ANTI-DONTS UNLESS APPROVED BY A QUALIFIED HEALER. There was also a
large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets which was labelled:
Dilys Derwent
St. Mungos Healer 1722-
Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry 1741-
Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party closely as though counting them; when Harry caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Headmistress</b></font>) eye
she (<font color='blue'><b>Headmistress</b></font>) gave a tiny wink, walked sideways out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Headmistress</b></font>) portrait and vanished.
Meanwhile, at the front of the queue, a young wizard was performing an odd on-the-spot jig and
trying, in between yelps of pain, to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) predicament to the witch behind the desk.
``Its these - ouch - shoes my brother gave me - ow- theyre eating my - OUCH - feet - look at
them, there must be some kind of - AARGH - jinx on them and I cant - AAAAARGH - get
them off.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals.
``The shoes dont prevent you reading, do they?'' said the blonde witch, irritably pointing at a
large sign to the left of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) desk. ``You want Spell Damage, fourth floor. Just like it says on the
floor guide. Next!''
As the wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way, the Weasley party moved forward a
few steps and Harry read the floor guide:
ARTEFACT ACCIDENTS... Ground floor
Cauldron explosion, wand backfiring, broom crashes, etc..
CREATURE-INDUCED INJURIES... First floor
Bites, stings, burns, embedded spines, etc..
MAGICAL BUGS... Second floor
Contagious maladies, e.g. dragon pox, vanishing sickness, scrojungulus, etc..
POTION AND PLANT POISONING... Third floor
Rashes,regurgitation -LRB-uncontrollable-RRB-, etc..
SPELL DAMAGE... Fourth floor
Unliftable jinxes, hexes, and incorrectly applied charms, etc..
VISITORS TEAROOM AND HOSPITAL SHOP... Fifth floor
IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHERE TO GO, INCAPABLE OF NORMAL SPEECH OR
UNABLE TO REMEMBER WHY YOU ARE HERE, OUR WELCOME WITCH WILL BE
PLEASED TO HELP.
A very old, stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now.
``Im here to see Broderick Bode!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) wheezed.
``Ward forty-nine, but Im afraid youre wasting your time,'' said the witch dismissively. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>)s
completely addled, you know - still thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>)s a teapot. Next!''
A harassed-looking wizard was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) small daughter tightly by the ankle while she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) flapped
around his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) head using the immensely large, feathery wings that had sprouted right out through
the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) romper suit.
``Fourth floor,'' said the witch, in a bored voice, without asking, and the man disappeared through
the double doors beside the desk, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter like an oddly shaped balloon. ``Next!''
Mrs. Weasley moved forward to the desk.
``Hello,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, ``my husband, Arthur Weasley, was supposed to be moved to a different ward
this morning, could you tell us -?''
``Arthur Weasley?'' said the witch, running her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) finger down a long list in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>). ``Yes, first
floor, second door on the right, Dai Llewellyn Ward.''
``Thank you,'' said Mrs. Weasley. ``Come on, you lot.''
They followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond, which was
lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated
up on the ceiling, looking like giant soapsuds. More witches and wizards in lime-green robes
walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yellow gas wafted into the
passageway as they passed one door, and every now and then they heard distant wailing. They
climbed a flight of stairs and entered the Creature-Induced Injuries corridor, where the second
door on the right bore the words: Dangerous Dai Llewellyn Ward: Serious Bites. Underneath
this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten:Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates
Smethwyck. Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye.
``Well wait outside, Molly,'' Tonks said. ``Arthur wont want too many visitors at once... it ought to be just the family first.''
Mad-Eye growled his (<font color='blue'><b>Mad-Eye</b></font>) approval of this idea and set himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mad-Eye</b></font>) back against the corridor
wall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mad-Eye</b></font>) magical eye spinning in all directions. Harry drew back, too, but Mrs. Weasley reached
out a hand and pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) through the door, saying, ``Dont be silly, Harry, Arthur wants to
thank you.''
The ward was small and rather dingy, as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall
facing the door. Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle
of the ceiling. The walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather vicious-looking
wizard on the wall, captioned: Urquhart Rackharrow, 1612--1697, Inventor of the Entrail-expelling Curse.
There were only three patients. Mr. Weasley was occupying the bed at the far end of the ward
beside the tiny window. Harry was pleased and relieved to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was propped up on several
pillows and reading the Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
looked up as they walked towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and, seeing who it was, beamed.
``Hello!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) called, throwing the Prophet aside. ``Bill just left, Molly, had to get back to work, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)ll drop in on you later.''
``How are you, Arthur?'' asked Mrs. Weasley, bending down to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cheek and looking
anxiously into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face. ``Youre still looking a bit peaky.''
``I feel absolutely fine,'' said Mr. Weasley brightly, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) good arm to give Ginny a hug.
``If they could only take the bandages off, Id be f it to go home.''
``Why cant they take them off, Dad?'' asked Fred.
``Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,'' said Mr. Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) wand, which lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) bedside cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) bedside to seat them all. ``It seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snakes fangs that keeps wounds open. Theyre sure theyll find an antidote, though; they say theyve had much worse cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a
Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) voice
and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at
the ceiling. ``Bitten by a werewolf, poor chap. No cure at all.''
``A werewolf?'' whispered Mrs. Weasley, looking alarmed. ``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) safe in a public ward? Shouldnt he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) be in a private room?''
``Its two weeks till full moon,'' Mr. Weasley reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) quietly. ``Theyve been talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) this morning, the Healers, you know, trying to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)ll be able to lead an almost
normal life. I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) - didnt mention names, of course - but I said I knew a werewolf
personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite easy to manage.''
``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say?'' asked George.
``Said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)d give me another bite if I didnt shut up,'' said Mr. Weasley sadly. ``And that woman
over there,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) indicated the only other occupied bed, which was right beside the door, ``wont
tell the Healers what bit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), which makes us all think it must have been something she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
handling illegally. Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leg,very nasty smell when they
take off the dressings.''
``So, you going to tell us what happened, Dad?'' asked Fred, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) chair closer to the bed.
``Well, you already know, dont you?'' said Mr. Weasley, with a significant smile at Harry. ``Its
very simple - Id had a very long day, dozed off, got sneaked up on and bitten.''
``Is it in the Prophet, you being attacked?'' asked Fred, indicating the newspaper Mr. Weasley had cast aside.
``No, of course not,'' said Mr. Weasley, with a slightly bitter smile, ``the Ministry wouldnt want
everyone to know a dirty great serpent got --''
``Arthur!<div class="bookquote">'' Mrs. Weasley warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>).
'' (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Weasley</b></font>)</div>- got - er - me,'' Mr. Weasley said hastily, though Harry was quite sure that was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) had
meant to say.
``So where were you when it happened, Dad?'' asked George.
``Thats my business,'' said Mr. Weasley, though with a small smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) snatched up the Daily
Prophe, shook it open again and said, ``I was just reading about Willy Widdershinss arrest
when you arrived. You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets back in the
summer? One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded and they found him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) lying unconscious
in the wreckage covered from head to foot in -''
``When you say you were on duty,'' Fred interrupted in a low voice, ``what were you doing?''
``You heard your father,'' whispered Mrs. Weasley, ``we are not discussing this here! Go on about
Willy Widdershins, Arthur.''
``Well, dont ask me how, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) actually got off the toilet charge,'' said Mr. Weasley grimly. ``I
can only suppose gold changed hands -''
``You were guarding it, werent you?'' said George quietly. ``The weapon? The thing You-Know-
Whos after?''
``George, be quiet!'' snapped Mrs. Weasley.
``Anyway,'' said Mr. Weasley, in a raised voice, ``this time Willys been caught selling biting
doorknobs to Muggles and I dont think he (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>)ll be able to worm his (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) way out of it because,
according to this article, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungos for
emergency bone re-growth and memory modification. Just think of it, Muggles in St. Mungos! I
wonder which ward theyre in?''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost.
``Didnt you say You-Know-Whos got a snake, Harry?'' asked Fred, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father for a
reaction. ``A massive one? You saw it the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) returned, didnt you?''
``Thats enough,'' said Mrs. Weasley crossly. ``Mad-Eye and Tonks are outside, Arthur, they want
to come and see you. And you lot can wait outside,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) children and Harry. ``You
can come and say goodbye afterwards. Go on.''
They trooped back into the corridor. Mad-Eye and Tonks went in and closed the door of the ward
behind them. Fred raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) eyebrows.
``Fine,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said coolly, rummaging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pockets, ``be like that. Dont tell us anything.''
``Looking for these?'' said George, holding out what looked like a tangle of flesh-colored string.
``You read my mind,'' said Fred, grinning. ``Lets see if St. Mungos puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors, shall we?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable Ears from each other. Fred
and George handed them around. Harry hesitated to take one.
``Go on, Harry, take it! You saved Dads life. If anyones got the right to eavesdrop on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), its
you.''
Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ear as the
twins had done.
``Okay, go!<div class="bookquote">'' Fred whispered.
The flesh-colored strings wriggled like long skinny worms and snaked under the door. At first,
Harry could hear nothing, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jumped as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
were standing right beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>).
'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>... they searched the whole area but couldnt find the snake anywhere. It just seems to have
vanished after it attacked you, Arthur... but You-Know-Who cant have expected a snake to get
in, can he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)?''
``I reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sent it as a lookout,'' growled Moody, ``cause he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s not had any luck so far, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?
No, I reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s trying to get a clearer picture of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s facing and if Arthur hadnt been
there the beast wouldve had a lot more time to look around. So, Potter says he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) saw it all
happen?''
``Yes,'' said Mrs. Weasley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) sounded rather uneasy. ``You know, Dumbledore seems almost to
have been waiting for Harry to see something like this.''
``Yeah, well,'' said Moody, ``theres something funny about the Potter kid, we all know that.''
``Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) this morning,'' whispered Mrs
Weasley.
``Course he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s worried,'' growled Moody. ``The boys seeing things from inside You-Know-Whos
snake. Obviously, Potter doesnt realize what that means, but if You-Know-Whos possessing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) --''
Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart hammering very fast and heat rushing
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around at the others. They were all staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), the strings still trailing
from their ears, looking suddenly fearful.
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
Christmas on the Closed Ward
Was this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harrys eyes? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) expect to see Voldemort
staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with
catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced
itself out of the back of Professor Quirrells head and ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand over the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own,
wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) skull.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) felt dirty, contaminated, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the
Underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies
were free of the taint of Voldemort... he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had not merely seen the snake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) hadbeen the snake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)
knew it now...
A truly terrible thought then occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>), a memory bobbing to the surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) mind, one
that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) insides writhe and squirm like serpents.
Whats he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) after, apart from followers?
Stuff he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) can only get by stealth... like a weapon. Something he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) didnt have last time.
Im the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) veins,
chilling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out in a sweat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. Im
the one Voldemorts trying to use, thats why theyve got guards around me everywhere I go, its
not for my protection, its for other peoples, only its not working, they cant have someone on
me all the time at Hogwarts... I did attack Mr. Weasley last night, it was me. Voldemort made me do it and he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) could be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now -
``Are you all right, Harry, dear?'' whispered Mrs. Wea sley leaning across Ginny to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel. ``You dont look very well. Are you feeling sick?''
They were all watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) head violently and stared up at an advertisement for
home insurance.
``Harry, dear, are you sure youre all right?'' said Mrs. Weasley in a worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place. ``You look ever so pale... are you sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hours of sleep before dinner, all right?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the others, which was precisely
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) wanted, so when she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) opened the front door he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) hurried straight past the trolls-leg
umbrella stand, up the stairs and into his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) and Rons bedroom.
Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas Nigelluss empty picture
frame, his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas.
How had he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) become a snake? Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was an Animagus... no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) couldnt be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) would
know... perhapsVoldemort was an Animagus... yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would turn
into a snake of course... and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s possessing me, then we both transform... that still
doesnt explain how I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes... but
then Voldemorts about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, its
probably no problem at all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) to transport people like that.
And then, with a terrible stab of panic, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) thought,but this is insane - if Voldemorts possessing
me, Im giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) a clear view into the Headquarter s of the Order of the Phoenix right now!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)ll know whos in the Order and where Sirius is... and Ive heard loads of stuff I shouldnt
have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here...
There was only one thing for it: he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them safe over the
holidays at least... but no, that wouldnt do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to
maim and injure. What if it was Seamus, Dean or Neville next time? He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) pacing and
stood staring at Phineas Nigelluss empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
stomach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had no alternative: he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off
from other wizards entirely.
Well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had to do it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) thought, there was no point hanging around. Trying with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) might
not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) on their doorstep six
months earlier than they had expected, he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) strode over to his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) trunk, slammed the lid shut and
locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) was still at
Hogwarts - well, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) cage would be one less thing to carry - he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) seized one end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) trunk and
had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said, ``Running away, are we?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) portrait and was leaning
against the frame, watching Harry with an amused expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.
``Not running away, no,'' said Harry shortly, dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk a few more feet across the room.
``I thought,'' said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pointed beard, ``that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave! It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.''
``Its not my own neck Im saving,'' said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of
particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door.
``Oh, I see,'' said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beard, ``this is no cowardly flight - you are
being noble.''
Harry ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, ``I have a
message for you from Albus Dumbledore.''
Harry span round.
``What is it?<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Stay where you are.''
``I havent moved!'' said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand still upon the doorknob. ``So whats the message?''
``I have just given it to you, dolt,'' said Phineas Ni gellus smoothly. ``Dumbledore says, Stay
where you are.''
``Why?'' said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk. ``Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) want me to stay? What
else did he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) say?''
``Nothing whatsoever,'' said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found
Harry impertinent.
Harrys temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was exhausted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was confused beyond measure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had experienced terror, relief, then terror again in the last
twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)!
``So thats it, is it?<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said loudly. '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Stay where you a re! Thats all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those Dementors, too! Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We wont bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it!''
``You know,'' said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry ``this is precisely why I loathed
being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about
everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an
excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>) plans
to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledores
orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that
you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only one clever enough
to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning -''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is planning something to do with me, then?'' said Harry swiftly.
``Did I say that?'' said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) silk gloves. ``Now, if you will excuse
me, I have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising... good-day to you.''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strolled to the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) frame and out of sight.
``Fine, go then!'' Harry bellowed at the empty frame. ``And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!''
The empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk back to the foot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed,
then threw himself face down on the moth-eaten covers, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes shut, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body heavy and
aching.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had journeyed for miles and miles... it seemed impossible that less than
twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) under the mistletoe... he (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) was so
tired... he (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) was scared to sleep... yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) did not know how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) could fight it... Dumbledore
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) to stay... that must mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was allowed to sleep... but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was scared... what if it
happened again?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was sinking into shadows...
It was as though a film in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) head had been waiting to start. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was walking down a deserted
corridor towards a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway on to a
flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) reached the black door but could not open it... he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) stood gazing at it, desperate for entry...
something he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wanted with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) heart lay beyond... a prize beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) dreams... if only his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) scar
would stop prickling... then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) would be able to think more clearly...
``Harry,'' said Rons voice, from far, far away, ``Mum says dinners ready, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)ll save you
something if you want to stay in bed.''
Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, but Ron had already left the room.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) doesnt want to be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own with me, Harry thought. Not after what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Moody say.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) supposed none of them would want him (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) there any more, now that they knew what was inside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) would not go down to dinner; he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) would not inflict his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) company on them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) turned over on to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) other side and, after a while, dropped back off to sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) woke much later, in the early
hours of the morning, his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed. Squinting
around the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) portrait and it
occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), in
case he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) attacked somebody else.
The feeling of being unclean intensified. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) half-wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had not obeyed Dumbledore... if this
was how life was going to be for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) would be
better off in Privet Drive after all.
Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not
remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was actually singing carols, apparently
delighted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice echoing up
through the floor in the cold drawing room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sitting alone, watching the sky growing
whiter outside the windows, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), as they were bound to be doing.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Mrs. Weasley calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) name softly u p the stairs around lunchtime, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) retreated
further upstairs and ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>).
Around six oclock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs. Black started screaming again.
Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled
himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeaks room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was hiding, trying to
ignore how hungry he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fed dead rats to the Hippogriff. It came as a slight shock when
somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.
``I know youre in there,'' said Hermiones voice. ``Will you please come out? I want to talk to
you.''
``What are you doing here?'' Harry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) may have dropped. ``I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad?''
``Well, to tell the truth, skiings not really my thing,'' said Hermione. ``So, Ive come here for
Christmas.'' There was snow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hair and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face was pink with cold. ``But dont tell Ron. I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) its really good because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) kept laughing so much. Mum and Dad are a bit
disappointed, but Ive told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at
Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, theyll understand. Anyway,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said briskly,
``lets go to your bedroom, Rons mum has lit a fire in there and she (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>)s sent up sandwiches.''
Harry followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) back to the second floor. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) entered the bedroom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was rather
surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Rons bed.
``I came on the Knight Bus,'' said Hermione airily, pulling off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) jacket before Harry had time to speak. ``Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for
term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) nose, even though Dumbledore told her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) Mr. Weasley was in St. Mungos and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)d
given you all permission to visit. So...''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry.
``Howre you feeling?'' asked Hermione.
``Fine,'' said Harry stiffly.
``Oh, dont lie, Harry,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said impatiently. ``Ron and Ginny say youve been hiding from
everyone since you got back from St. Mungos.''
``They do, do they?'' said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet but
Ginny seemed quite unabashed.
``Well, you have!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) said. ``And you wont look at any of us!''
``Its you lot who wont look at me!'' said Harry ang rily.
``Maybe youre taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,'' suggested Hermione, the
corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth twitching.
``Very funny,'' snapped Harry, turning away.
``Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,'' said Hermione sharply. ``Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears -''
``Yeah?'' growled Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pockets as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watched the snow now falling
thickly outside. ``All been talking about me, have you? Well, Im getting used to it.''
``We wanted to talk to you, Harry,'' said Ginny, ``but as youve been hiding ever since we got back -''
``I didnt want anyone to talk to me,'' said Harry, w ho was feeling more and more nettled.
``Well, that was a bit stupid of you,'' said Ginny angrily, ``seeing as you dont know anyone but
me whos been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.''
Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wheeled round.
``I forgot,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
``Lucky you,'' said Ginny coolly.
``Im sorry'' Harry said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) meant it. ``So... so, do you think Im being possessed, then?''
``Well, can you remember everything youve been doing?'' Ginny asked. ``Are there big blank
periods where you dont know what youve been up to?''
Harry racked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brains.
``No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
``Then You-Know-Who hasnt ever possessed you,'' said Ginny simply. ``When he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did it to me, I
couldnt remember what Id been doing for hours at a time. Id find myself somewhere and not
know how I got there.''
Harry hardly dared believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>), yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart was lightening almost in spite of himself.
``That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though --''
``Harry youve had these dreams before,'' Hermione said. ``You had flashes of what Voldemort
was up to last year.''
``This was different,'' said Harry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. ``I was inside that snake. It was like I was the
snake... what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London --?''
``One day,'' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, ``youll read Hogwarts: A History,
and perhaps it will remind you that you cant Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts. Even
Voldemort couldnt just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.''
``You didnt leave your bed, mate,'' said Ron. ``I saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at
least a minute before we could wake you up.''
Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not
only comforting, it made sense... without really thinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a sandwich from the plate on
the bed and crammed it hungrily into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth.
Im not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeaks room, singing ``God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs'' at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) voice.
How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Siriuss delight at
having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was no
longer their sullen host of the summer; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed determined that everyone should enjoy
themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) worked
tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the
time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable. The tarnished
chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver
streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree,
obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Siriuss family tree from view,
and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards.
Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed and Ron
already halfway through opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own, rather larger, pile.
``Good haul this year,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) informed Harry through a cloud of paper. ``Thanks for the Broom
Compass, its excellent; beats Hermiones - she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got me a homework planner-''
Harry sorted through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) presents and found one with Hermiones handwriting on it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), too, a book that resembled a diary except that it said things like ``Do it today or later you'll pay!'' every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opend a page.
Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see it was going to be highly useful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) plans for the D.A.. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers ripped off. Tonkss present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) still
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) full-size version; Ron had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) an enormous box of Every-Flavour Beans, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies, and Dobby a truly dreadful
painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just turned it upsidedown
to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loudcrack, Fred and George
Apparated at the foot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Apparated</b></font>) bed.
``Merry Christmas,'' said George. ``Dont go downstairs for a bit.''
``Why not?'' said Ron.
``Mums crying again,'' said Fred heavily. ``Percy sent back his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) Christmas jumper.''
``Without a note,'' added George. ``Hasnt asked how Dad is or visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) or anything.''
``We tried to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>),'' said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harrys portrait. ``Told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) Percys nothing more than a humungous pile of rat droppings.''
``Didnt work,'' said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog. ``So Lupin took over. Best let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon.''
``Whats that supposed to be, anyway?'' asked Fred, squinting at Dobbys painting. ``Looks like a
gibbon with two black eyes.''
``Its Harry!'' said George, pointing at the back of the picture, ``says so on the back!''
``Good likeness,'' said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new homework diary at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); it hit the wall
opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily: ``If youve dotted the is and crossed the ts then you may do whatever you please!''
They got up and dressed. They could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling ``Merry
Christmas'' to one another. On their way downstairs they met Hermione.
``Thanks for the book, Harry'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said happily. ``Ive been wanting that New Theory of
Numerology for ages! And that perfumes really unusual, Ron.''
``No problem,'' said Ron. ``Whos that for, anyway?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) added, nodding at the neatly wrapped
present she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was carrying.
``Kreacher,'' said Hermione brightly.
``It had better not be clothes!'' Ron warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). ``You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we cant set him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) free!''
``It isnt clothes,'' said Hermione, ``although if I had my way Id certainly give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) something to
wear other than that filthy old rag. No, its a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
bedroom.''
``What bedroom?'' said Harry, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Siriuss mother.
``Well, Sirius says its not so much a bedroom, more a kind of -den,'' said Hermione. ``Apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen.''
Mrs. Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was standing at
the stove and sounded as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had a bad head cold as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wished them ``Merry Christmas,''
and they all averted their eyes.
``So, is this Kreachers bedroom?'' said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite
the pantry. Harry had never seen it open.
``Yes,'' said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. ``Er... I think wed better knock.''
Ron rapped on the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) knuckles but there was no reply.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) must be sneaking around upstairs,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, and without further ado pulled open the door.
``Urgh!''
Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned
boiler, but in the foots space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that
looked like a nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and
the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here
and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese. In a far
corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from
Siriuss purge of the house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family
photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but
still the little black-and-white people inside them peered up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) haughtily, including - he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) felt a
little jolt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) stomach - the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had witnessed in
Dumbledores Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was Kreachers favorite
photograph; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with
Spellotape.
``I think Ill just leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) present here,'' said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle
of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>)ll find it later, thatll
be fine.''
``Come to think of it,'' said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, ``has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?''
``I havent seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) since the night we came back here,'' said Harry. ``You were ordering him (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) out of the kitchen.''
``Yeah...'' said Sirius, frowning. ``You know, I think thats the last time I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>), too... he (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) must
be hiding upstairs somewhere.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) couldnt have left, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>)?'' said Harry. ``I mean, when you said out, maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) thought you meant get out of the house?''
``No, no, house-elves cant leave unless theyre given clothes. Theyre tied to their familys
house,'' said Sirius.
``They can leave the house if they really want to,'' Harry contradicted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Dobby did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) left the Malfoys to give me warnings two years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) had to punish himself afterwards, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) still managed it.''
Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, ``Ill look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) later, I expect Ill
find him (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) upstairs crying his (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>) eyes out over my mothers old bloomers or something. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merry</b></font>)
might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died... but I mustnt get my hopes up.''
Fred, George and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful.
Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys, Harry and Hermione were planning to
pay Mr. Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time
for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to borrow a car for the occasion, as the
Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The car, which Harry doubted very much had been
taken with the knowledge or consent of it's owner, had had a similar Enlarging Spell put upon it as the Weasley's old Ford Anglia; although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably. Mrs. Weasley hesitated before getting inside - Harry knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) dislike of traveling without magic - but, finally, the cold outside and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) childrens pleading triumphed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace.
The journey to St. Mungos was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads. A small
trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the
hospital. Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to
wait for them. They strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon
stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass.
The reception area looked pleasantly festive: the crystal orbs that illuminated St. Mungos had
been colored red and gold to become gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around
every doorway; and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered
in every corner, each one topped with a gleaming gold star. It was less crowded than the last time
they had been there, although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a
witch with a walnut jammed up her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) left nostril.
``Family argument, eh?'' smirked the blonde witch behind the desk. ``Youre the third Ive seen
today... Spell Damage, fourth floor.''
They found Mr. Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) turkey dinner on a tray on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
lap and a rather sheepish expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) face.
``Everything all right, Arthur?'' asked Mrs. Weasley, after they had all greeted Mr. Weasley and
handed over their presents.
``Fine, fine,'' said Mr. Weasley, a little too heartily. ``You -- er -- havent seen Healer
Smethwyck, have you?''
``No,'' said Mrs. Weasley suspiciously, ``why?''
``Nothing, nothing,'' said Mr. Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) pile of gifts. ``Well, everyone
had a good day? What did you all get for Christmas? Oh, Harry - this is absolutely wonderful!'' For he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) had just opened Harrys gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers.
Mrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr. Weasleys answer. As her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) husband leaned
over to shake Harrys hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) peered at the bandaging under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nightshirt.
``Arthur,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, with a snap in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) voice like a mousetrap, ``youve had your bandages
changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they
wouldnt need doing until tomorrow.''
``What?'' said Mr. Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
chest. ``No, no - its nothing - its -I-''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) seemed to deflate under Mrs. Weasleys piercing gaze.
``Well - now dont get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea... he (<font color='blue'><b>Pye</b></font>)s the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in... um... complementary medicine... I mean,
some of these old Muggle remedies... well, theyre called stitches, Molly, and they work very
well on - on Muggle wounds -''
Mrs. Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled
away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather
wistfully at the crowd around Mr. Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup
of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), grinning.
``Do you mean to tell me,'' said Mrs. Weasley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) voice growing louder with every word and
apparently unaware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, ``that you have been
messing about with Muggle remedies?''
``Not messing about, Molly, dear,'' said Mr. Weasley imploringly, ``it was just - just something Pye and I thought wed try - only, most unfortunately -- well, with these particular kinds of wounds - it doesnt seem to work as well as wed hoped -''
``Meaning?''
``Well... well, I dont know whether you know what - what stitches are?''
``It sounds as though youve been trying to sew your skin back together,'' said Mrs. Weasley with
a snort of mirthless laughter, ``but even you, Arthur, wouldnt be that stupid --''
``I fancy a cup of tea, too,'' said Harry, jumping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet.
Hermione, Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). As it swung closed behind them,
they heard Mrs. Weasley shriek, ``WHAT DO YOU MEAN, TH ATS THE GENERAL IDEA?''
``Typical Dad,'' said Ginny, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) head as they set off up the corridor. ``Stitches... I ask
you...''
``Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,'' said Hermione fairly. ``I suppose
something in that snakes venom dissolves them or something. I wonder where the tearoom is?''
``Fifth floor,'' said Harry, remembering the sign over the welcome witchs desk.
They walked along the corridor, through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined
with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers. As they climbed it, the various Healers called out
to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was seriously
affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) clearly had a bad case of spattergroit.
``And whats that supposed to be?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) asked angrily, as the Healer pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) through six more
portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way.
``Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and
more gruesome even than you are now -''
``Watch who youre calling gruesome!<div class="bookquote">'' said Ron, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ears turning red.
'' (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>- the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about your throat, stand naked at the
full moon in a barrel of eels eyes -''
``I have not got spattergroit!''
``But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master -''
``Theyre freckles!'' said Ron furiously. ``Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces.
``What floors this?''
``I think its the fifth,'' said Hermione.
``Nah, its the fourth,'' said Harry, ``one more --''
But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stepped on to the landing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set
into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man
was peering out at them all with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose pressed against the glass. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had wavy blond hair,
bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth.
``Blimey!'' said Ron, also staring at the man.
``Oh, my goodness,'' said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless. ``Professor Lockhart!''
Their ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved towards
them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown.
``Well, hello there!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said. ``I expect youd like my autograph, would you?''
``Hasnt changed much, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>)?'' Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned.
``Er -- how are you, Professor?'' said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. It had been Rons
malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockharts memory so badly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) had
landed in St. Mungos in the first place, though as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently
wipe Harry and Rons memories at the time, Harrys sympathy was limited.
``Im very well indeed, thank you!'' said Lockhart exuberantly, pulling a rather battered peacockfeather quill from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) pocket. ``Now, how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing now, you know!''
``Er - we dont want any at the moment, thanks,'' said Ron, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyebrows at Harry, who
asked, ``Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors? Shouldnt you be in a ward?''
The smile faded slowly from Lockharts face. For a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) gazed intently at Harry,
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, ``Havent we met?''
``Er... yeah, we have,'' said Harry. ``You used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember?''
``Teach?'' repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. ``Me? Did I?''
And then the smile reappeared upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face so suddenly it was rather alarming.
``Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I? Well, how about those autographs, then?
Shall we say a round dozen, you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be
left out!''
But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called,
``Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to?''
A motherly-looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) hair came bustling up the corridor,
smiling warmly at Harry and the others.
``Oh, Gilderoy, youve got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas Day, too! Do you know,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>) never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I cant think why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>)s such a sweetie, arent you?''
``Were doing autographs!'' Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile. ``They want
loads of them, wont take no for an answer! I just hope weve got enough photographs!''
``Listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>),'' said the Healer, taking Lockharts arm and beaming fondly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>)
were a precocious two-year-old. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>) was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope
that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>) memory might be starting to come back.
Will you step this way? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>)s in a closed ward, you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>) must have slipped out while I was
bringing in the Christmas presents, the doors usually kept locked... not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>)s dangerous!
But,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) voice to a whisper, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>)s a bit of a danger to himself, bless him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>)... doesnt
know who he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>) is, you see, wanders off and cant remember how to get back... it is nice of you to
have come to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>).''
``Er,'' said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, ``actually, we were just -- er -''
But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Rons feeble mutter of ``going to have a cup
of tea'' trailed away into nothingness. They looked at each other helplessly, then followed
Lockhart and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) Healer along the corridor.
``Lets not stay long,'' Ron said quietly.
The Healer pointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) wand at the door of the Janus Thickey Ward and muttered, ``Alohomora.''
The door swung open and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) led the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoys arm until
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) had settled him (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) into an armchair beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) bed.
``This is our long-term residents ward,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lockhart</b></font>) informed Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny
in a low voice. ``For permanent spell damage, you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself; and weve seen a real improvement in Mr. Bode, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bode</b></font>) seems to be regaining th e power of speech very well, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bode</b></font>) isnt speaking any language we recognize yet. Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, Ill leave you all to chat.''
Harry looked around. The ward bore unmistakable signs of being a permanent home to its
residents. They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr. Weasleys ward;
the wall around Gilderoys headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of himself, all
beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>) had autographed many of them to himself in
disjointed, childish writing. The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>) had been deposited in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilderoy</b></font>) chair by the Healer,
Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>), seized a quill and started signing them
all feverishly.
``You can put them in envelopes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) said to Ginny, throwing the signed pictures into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) lap one
by one as he (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) finished them. ``I am not forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of
fan mail... Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly... I just wish I knew why.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) signing with renewed vigour. ``I suspect it is simply my good looks...''
A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling; he (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) was
mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>). Two beds along was a
woman whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something similar happening
to Hermione during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) case, had not been
permanent. At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give
the occupants and their visitors some privacy.
``Here you are, Agnes,'' said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a small
pile of Christmas presents. ``See, not forgotten, are you? And your sons sent an owl to say he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)s
visiting tonight, so thats nice, isnt it?''
Agnes gave several loud barks.
``And look, Broderick, youve been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy Hippogriff for each month; theyll brighten things up, wont they?'' said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) wand. ``And - oh, Mrs. Longbottom, are you leaving already?''
Harrys head span round. The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the
ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking
old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what
was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) looking thoroughly depressed -
Neville.
With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realized who the people in the end beds must be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward
unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had also looked up at the sound of the name ``Longbottom'', and before Harry could stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had called out, ``Neville!''
Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>).
``Its us, Neville!'' said Ron brightly, getting to h i s feet. ``Have you seen -? Lockharts here!
Whove you been visiting?''
``Friends of yours, Neville, dear?'' said Nevilles grandmother graciously, bearing down upon
them all.
Neville looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) would rather be anywhere in the world but here. A dull purple flush
was creeping up his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) plump face and he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) was not making eye contact with any of them.
``Ah, yes,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) grandmother, looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shrivelled, clawlike
hand for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to shake. ``Yes, yes, I know who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of
you.''
``Er - thanks,'' said Harry, shaking hands. Neville did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>), but surveyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) own feet,
the color deepening in his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) face all the while.
``And you two are clearly Weasleys,'' Mrs. Longbottom continued, proffering her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) hand regally to
Ron and Ginny in turn. ``Yes, I know your parents -- not well, of course -- but fine people, fine
people... and you must be Hermione Granger?''
Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs. Longbottom knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) name, but shook hands all the
same.
``Yes, Nevilles told me all about you. Helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) out of a few sticky spots, havent you? He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)s a
good boy,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) said, casting a sternly appraising look down her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) rather bony nose at Neville, ``but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) hasnt got his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) fathers talent, Im afraid to say.'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) jerked her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward, so that the stuffed vulture on her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) hat trembled alarmingly.
``What?'' said Ron, looking amazed. -LRB-Harry wanted to stamp on Rons foot, but that sort of thing
is much harder to bring off unnoticed when youre wearing jeans rather than robes.-RRB- ``Is that
your dad down the end, Neville?''
``Whats this?'' said Mrs. Longbottom sharply. ``Havent you told your friends about your parents, Neville?''
Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) head. Harry could not
remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not think of any way of helping Neville
out of the situation.
``Well, its nothing to be ashamed of!'' said Mrs. Longbottom angrily. ``You should be proud,
Neville, proud! They didnt give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, you know!''
``Im not ashamed,'' said Neville, very faintly, still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others.
Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds.
``Well, youve got a funny way of showing it!'' said Mrs. Longbottom. ``My son and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, ``were tortured into insanity by You- Know-Whos followers.''
Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths. Ron stopped craning his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) neck
to catch a glimpse of Nevilles parents and looked mortified.
``They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the wizarding community'' Mrs.
Longbottom went on. ``Highly gifted, the pair of them. I - yes, Alice dear, what is it?''
Nevilles mother had come edging down the ward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) nightdress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) no longer had the
plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moodys old photograph of the original Order of
the Phoenix. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) face was thin and worn now, her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) eyes seemed overlarge and her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) hair, which had
turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>)
was not able to, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) made timid motions towards Neville, holding something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>)
outstretched hand.
``Again?'' said Mrs. Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. ``Very well, Alice dear, very well -
Neville, take it, whatever it is.''
But Neville had already stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) hand, into which his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) mother dropped an empty
Droobles Best Blowing Gum wrapper.
``Very nice, dear,'' said Nevilles grandmother in a falsely cheery voice, patting his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) mother on the
shoulder.
But Neville said quietly, ``Thanks, Mum.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the
others, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d ever
found anything less funny in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life.
``Well, wed better get back,'' sighed Mrs Longbottom, drawing on long green gloves. ``Very nice
to have met you all. Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) must have given you enough of
them to paper your bedroom by now.''
But as they left, Harry was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Neville slip the candy wrapper into his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) pocket.
The door closed behind them.
``I never knew,'' said Hermione, who looked tearful.
``Nor did I,'' said Ron rather hoarsely.
``Nor me,'' whispered Ginny.
They all looked at Harry.
``I did,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said glumly. ``Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldnt tell anyone... thats what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Nevilles parents until they lost their minds.''
``Bellatrix Lestrange did that?'' whispered Hermione, horrified. ``That woman Kreachers got a
photo of in his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) den?''
There was a long silence, broken by Lockharts angry voice.
``Look, I didnt learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!''
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
Occlumency
Kreacher, it transpired, had been lurking in the attic. Sirius said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had found him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) up there,
covered in dust, no doubt looking for more relics of the Black family to hide in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) cupboard.
Though Sirius seemed satisfied with this story, it made Harry uneasy. Kreacher seemed to be in a
better mood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reappearance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) submitted
to orders more docilely than usual, though once or twice Harry caught the house-elf staring at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) avidly, but always looking quickly away whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw that Harry had noticed.
Harry did not mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast
now that Christmas was over. As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)
became more and more prone to what Mrs. Weasley call ed fits of the sullens, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) would become taciturn and grumpy, often withdrawing to Buckbeaks room for hours at a time. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) gloom seeped through the house, oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them became infected by it.
Harry didnt want to leave Sirius again with only Kreacher for company; in fact, for the first time
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts. Going back to school would
mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge, who had no doubt
managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence; there was no Quidditch to look
forward to now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been banned; there was every likelihood that their burden of
homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; and Dumbledore remained as remote
as ever. In fact, if it hadnt been for the D.A., Harry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might have begged Sirius to let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place.
Then, on the very last day of the holidays, something happened that made Harry positively dread
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) return to school.
``Harry, dear,'' said Mrs. Weasley, poking her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) head in to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Rons bedroom, where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by Hermione, Ginny and Crookshanks, ``could you
come down to the kitchen? Professor Snape would like a word with you.''
Harry did not immediately register what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) had said; one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) castles was engaged in a violent
tussle with a pawn of Rons and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was egging it on enthusiastically.
``Squash him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) - squash him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)s only a pawn, you idiot. Sorry, Mrs. Weasley, what did you say?''
``Professor Snape, dear. In the kitchen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)d like a word.''
Harrys mouth fell open in horror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around at Ron, Hermione and Ginny, all of whom
were gaping back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Crookshanks, whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for
the past quarter of an hour, leapt gleefully on to the board and set the pieces running for cover,
squealing at the top of their voices.
``Snape?'' said Harry blankly.
``Professor Snape, dear,'' said Mrs. Weasley reprovingly. ``Now come on, quickly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) cant stay long.''
``Whats he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) want with you?'' said Ron, looking unnerved as Mrs. Weasley withdrew from the
room. ``You havent done anything, have you?''
``No!'' said Harry indignantly, racking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brains to think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could have done that would
make Snape pursue him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) to Grimmauld Place. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) last piece of homework perhaps earned a T?
A minute or two later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) pushed open the kitchen door to find Sirius and Snape both seated at
the long kitchen table, glaring in opposite directions. The silence between them was heavy with
mutual dislike. A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius.
``Er,'' said Harry, to announce his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) presence.
Snape looked around at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face framed between curtains of greasy black hair.
``Sit down, Potter.''
``You know,'' said Sirius loudly, leaning back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling, ``I
think Id prefer it if you didnt give orders here, Snape. Its my house, you see.''
An ugly flush suffused Snapes pallid face. Harry sat down in a chair beside Sirius, facing Snape
across the table.
``I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,'' said Snape, the familiar sneer curling his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) mouth, ``but
Black -''
``Im his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) godfather,'' said Sirius, louder than ever.
``I am here on Dumbledores orders,'' said Snape, whose voice, by contrast, was becoming more
and more quietly waspish, ``but by all means stay, Black, I know you like to feel... involved.''
``Whats that supposed to mean?'' said Sirius, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) chair fall back on to all four legs with a
loud bang.
``Merely that I am sure you must feel - ah - frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful,''
Snape laid a delicate stress on the word, ``for the Order.''
It was Siriuss turn to flush. Snapes lip curled in triumph as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) turned to Harry.
``The Headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) wish for you to study Occlumency
this term.''
``Study what?'' said Harry blankly.
Snapes sneer became more pronounced.
``Occlumency, Potter. The magical Defense of the mind against external penetration. An obscure
branch of magic, but a highly useful one.''
Harrys heart began to pump very fast indeed. Defense against external penetration? But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
not being possessed, they had all agreed on that...
``Why do I have to study Occlu -- thing?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) blurted out.
``Because the Headmaster thinks it a good idea,'' said Snape smoothly. ``You will receive private
lessons once a week, but you will not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores
Umbridge. You understand?''
``Yes,'' said Harry. ``Whos going to be teaching me?''
Snape raised an eyebrow.
``I am,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) said.
Harry had the horrible sensation that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides were melting.
Extra lessons with Snape - what on earth had he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) done to deserve this? He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) looked quickly round
at Sirius for support.
``Why cant Dumbledore teach Harry?'' asked Sirius aggressively. ``Why you?''
``I suppose because it is a headmasters privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,'' said Snape
silkily. ``I assure you I did not beg for the job.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) feet. ``I will expect you at six oclock on Monday evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking remedial Potions.
Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) turned to leave, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) black traveling cloak billowing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>).
``Wait a moment,'' said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) chair.
Snape turned back to face them, sneering.
``I am in rather a hurry, Black. Unlike you, I do not have unlimited leisure time.''
``Ill get to the point, then,'' said Sirius, standing up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was rather taller than Snape who, Harry
noticed, balled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fist in the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wand. ``If I hear youre using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, youll have
me to answer to.''
``How touching,'' Snape sneered. ``But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) father?''
``Yes, I have,'' said Sirius proudly.
``Well then, youll know he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)s so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>),'' Snape said
sleekly.
Sirius pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards Snape, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
wand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) went. Snape whipped out his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius
looking livid, Snape calculating, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes darting from Siriuss wand-tip to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) face.
``Sirius!'' said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>).
``Ive warned you, Snivellus,'' said Sirius, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) face barely a foot from Snapes, ``I dont care if
Dumbledore thinks youve reformed, I know better -''
``Oh, but why dont you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) so?'' whispered Snape. ``Or are you afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) might not take very
seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) mothers house for six months?''
``Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)s delighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) lapdogs working at
Hogwarts, isnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)?''
``Speaking of dogs,'' said Snape softly, ``did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognized you last
time you risked a little jaunt outside? Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station
platform... gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future, didnt it?''
Sirius raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wand.
``NO!'' Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them. ``Sirius, dont!''
``Are you calling me a coward?'' roared Sirius, trying to push Harry out of the way, but Harry
would not budge.
``Why, yes, I suppose I am,'' said Snape.
``Harry - get - out - of - it!'' snarled Sirius, pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) aside with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) free hand.
The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking
very happy, with Mr. Weasley walking proudly in thei r midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamass covered by a mackintosh.
``Cured!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) announced brightly to the kitchen at large. ``Completely cured!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the scene in front of them, which
was also suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and Snape looking towards the door with their
wands pointing into each others faces and Harry immobile between them, a hand stretched out
to each, trying to force them apart.
``Merlins beard,'' said Mr. Weasley, the smile slidin g off his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) face, ``whats going on here?''
Both Sirius and Snape lowered their wands. Harry looked from one to the other. Each wore an
expression of utmost contempt, yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to
have brought them to their senses. Snape pocketed his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand, turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) heel and swept back
across the kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment. At the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) looked back.
``Six oclock, Monday evening, Potter.''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was gone. Sirius glared after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wand at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) side.
``Whats been going on?'' asked Mr. Weasley again.
``Nothing, Arthur,'' said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had just run a long
distance. ``Just a friendly little chat between two old school friends.'' With what looked like an
enormous effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) smiled. ``So... youre cured? Thats great news, really great.''
``Yes, isnt it?'' said Mrs. Weasley, leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) husb and forward to a chair. ``Healer Smethwyck
worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) magic in the end, found an antidote to whatever that snakes got in its fangs, and
Arthurs learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, havent you, dear?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) added,
rather menacingly.
``Yes, Molly, dear,'' said Mr. Weasley meekly.
That nights meal should have been a cheerful one, with Mr. Weasley back amongst them. Harry
could tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) godfather was not forcing himself to
laugh loudly at Fred and Georges jokes or offering everyone more food, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face fell back into a
moody, brooding expression. Harry was separated from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who
had dropped in to offer Mr. Weasley their congratulations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) shouldnt listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) deliberately and that the
rest of them didnt think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) and remaining in
Grimmauld Place. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had no opportunity to do so, and, eyeing the ugly look on Siriuss face,
Harry wondered occasionally whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have dared to mention it even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had the
chance. Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told Ron and Hermione under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice about having to take Occlumency
lessons with Snape.
``Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,'' said Hermione at once. ``Well, you wont be sorry not to have them any more, will you?''
``Extra lessons with Snape?'' said Ron, sounding aghast. ``Id rather have the nightmares!''
They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day, escorted once again by
Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when Harry, Ron and
Hermione came down next morning. The adults seemed to have been mid-way through a
whispered conversation as Harry opened the door; all of them looked round hastily and fell
silent.
After a hurried breakfast, they all pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly grey January
morning. Harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not want to say
goodbye to Sirius. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had a bad feeling about this parting; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) didnt know when they would next
see each other and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) felt it was incumbent upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) to say something to Sirius to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
doing anything stupid - Harry was worried that Snapes accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius
so badly he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place. Before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could think of what to say, however, Sirius had beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) side.
``I want you to take this,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harrys hands.
``What is it?'' Harry asked.
``A way of letting me know if Snapes giving you a hard time. No, dont open it in here!'' said
Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs. Weasley, who was trying to persuade the twins to wear handknitted mittens. ``I doubt Molly would approve - but I want you to use it if you need me, all
right?''
``Okay,'' said Harry, stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jacket, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
would never use whatever it was. It would not be he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Harry, who lured Sirius from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) place of
safety, no matter how foully Snape treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) in their forthcoming Occlumency classes.
``Lets go, then,'' said Sirius, clapping Harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly, and before
Harry could say anything else, they were heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained
and bolted front door, surrounded by Weasleys.
``Goodbye, Harry, take care,'' said Mrs. Weasley, hugg ing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``See you, Harry, and keep an eye out for snakes for me!'' said Mr. Weasley genially, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
hand.
``Right - yeah,'' said Harry distractedly; it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) last chance to tell Sirius to be careful; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
turned, looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) godfathers face: and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth to speak, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could do
so Sirius was giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) a brief, one-armed hug, and saying gruffly, ``Look after yourself,
Harry.'' Next moment, Harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air, with Tonks
-LRB-today heavily disguised as a tall, tweedy woman with iron-grey hair-RRB- chivvying him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) down the
steps.
The door of number twelve slammed shut behind them. They followed Lupin down the front
steps. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) reached the pavement, Harry looked round. Number twelve was shrinking rapidly as
those on either side of it stretched sideways, squeezing it out of sight. One blink later, it had
gone.
``Come on, the quicker we get on the bus the better,'' said Tonks, and Harry thought there was
nervousness in the glance she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) threw around the square. Lupin flung out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) right arm.
BANG.
A violently purple, triple-decker bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them, narrowly
avoiding the nearest lamppost, which jumped backwards out of its way.
A thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said,
``Welcome to the -''
``Yes, yes, we know, thank you,'' said Tonks swiftly. ``On, on, get on -''
And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoved Harry forwards towards the steps, past the conductor, who goggled at Harry as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed.
``Ere - its Arry -!''
``If you shout his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) name I will curse you into oblivion,'' muttered Tonks menacingly, now shunting
Ginny and Hermione forwards.
``Ive always wanted to go on this thing,'' said Ron happily, joining Harry on board and looking
around.
It had been evening the last time Harry had traveled by Knight Bus and its three decks had been
full of brass bedsteads. Now, in the early morning, it was crammed with an assortment of
mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows. Some of these appeared to have fallen
over when the bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place; a few witches and wizards were still
getting to their feet, grumbling, and somebodys shopping bag had slid the length of the bus: an
unpleasant mixture of frogspawn, cockroaches and custard creams was scattered all over the
floor.
``Looks like well have to split up,'' said Tonks briskly, looking around for empty chairs. ``Fred,
George and Ginny, if you just take those seats at the back... Remus can stay with you.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>), Harry, Ron and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck, where there were two
unoccupied chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back. Stan Shunpike, the conductor,
followed Harry and Ron eagerly to the back. Heads turned as Harry passed and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat
down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw all the faces flick back to the front again.
As Harry and Ron handed Stan eleven Sickles each, the bus set off again, swaying ominously. It
rumbled around Grimmauld Place, weaving on and off the pavement, then, with another
tremendous BANG, they were all flung backwards; Rons chair toppled right over and
Pigwidgeon, who had been on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) lap, burst out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) cage and flew twittering wildly up to the
front of the bus where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fluttered down on to Hermiones shoulder instead. Harry, who had
narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket, looked out of the window: they were now
speeding down what appeared to be a motorway.
``Just outside Birmingham,'' said Stan happily, answe ring Harrys unasked question as Ron
struggled up from the floor. ``You keepin well, then, Arry? I seen your name in the paper loads
over the summer, but it werent never nuffink very nice. I said to Ern, I said, e didnt seem like a
nutter when we met im, just goes to show, dunnit?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) handed over their tickets and continued to gaze, enthralled, at Harry. Apparently, Stan did not
care how nutty somebody was, if they were famous enough to be in the paper. The Knight Bus
swayed alarmingly, overtaking a line of cars on the inside. Looking towards the front of the bus,
Harry saw Hermione cover her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands, Pigwidgeon swaying happily on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
shoulder.
BANG.
Chairs slid backwards again as the Knight Bus jumped from the Birmingham motorway to a
quiet country lane full of hairpin bends. Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of
their way as they mounted the verges. From here they moved to a main street in the middle of a
busy town, then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills, then to a windswept road between high-rise
flats, each time with a loud BANG.
``Ive changed my mind,'' muttered Ron, picking himse lf up from the floor for the sixth time, ``I
never want to ride on this thing again.''
``Listen, its Ogwarts stop after this,'' said Stan brightly, swaying towards them. ``That bossy
woman up front oo got on with you, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)s given us a little tip to move you up the queue. Were
just gonna let Madam Marsh off first, though -<div class="bookquote">'' there was more retching from downstairs, followed by a horrible spattering sound '' (<font color='red'><b>Madam Marsh</b></font>)</div>- she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)s not feeling er best.''
A few minutes later, the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub, which squeezed
itself out of the way to avoid a collision. They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam
Marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsh</b></font>) fellow passengers on the second deck.
The bus moved on again, gathering speed, until -
BANG.
They were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade. Harry caught a glimpse of the Hogs Head down
its side street, the severed boars head sign creaking in the wintry wind. Flecks of snow hit the
large window at the front of the bus. At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to Hogwarts.
Lupin and Tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage, then got off to say goodbye. Harry
glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them,
noses flat against the windows.
``Youll be safe once youre in the grounds,'' said Tonks, casting a careful eye around at the
deserted road. ``Have a good term, okay?''
``Look after yourselves,'' said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last. ``And
listen...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice while the rest of the m exchanged last-minute goodbyes with
Tonks, ``Harry, I know you dont like Snape, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) is a superb Occlumens and we all - Sirius
included - want you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right?''
``Yeah, all right,'' said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupins prematurely lined face. ``See you,
then.''
The six of them struggled up the slippery drive towards the castle, dragging their trunks.
Hermione was already talking about knitting a few elf hats before bedtime. Harry glanced back
when they reached the oaken front doors; the Knight Bus had already gone and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) half-wished,
given what was coming the following evening, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was still on board.
Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) morning double-Potions lesson did
nothing to dispel his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trepidation, as Snape was as unpleasant as ever. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mood was further
lowered by the D.A. members constantly approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the corridors between classes, askinghopefully if there would be a meeting that night.
``Ill let you know in the usual way when the next one is,'' Harry said over and over again, ``but I
cant do it tonight, Ive got to go to - er - remedial Potions.''
``You take remedial Potions!'' asked Zacharias Smith superciliously, having cornered Harry in the Entrance Hall after lunch. ``Good Lord, you must be terrible. Snape doesnt usually give extra
lessons, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)?''
As Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion, Ron glared after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).
``Shall I jinx him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)? I can still get him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) from here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wand and taking aim between Smiths shoulder blades.
``Forget it,'' said Harry dismally. ``Its what everyones going to think, isnt it? That Im really
stup --''
``Hi, Harry,'' said a voice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned round and found Cho standing there.
``Oh,'' said Harry as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach leapt uncomfortably. ``Hi.''
``Well be in the library, Harry,'' said Hermione firmly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) seized Ron above the elbow and
dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) off towards the marble staircase.
``Had a good Christmas?'' asked Cho.
``Yeah, not bad,'' said Harry.
``Mine was pretty quiet,'' said Cho. For some reason, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was looking rather embarrassed.
``Erm... theres another Hogsmeade trip next month, did you see the notice?''
``What? Oh, no, I havent checked the noticeboard since I got back.''
``Yes, its on Valentines Day...''
``Right,'' said Harry, wondering why she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) this. ``Well, I suppose you want to -?''
``Only if you do,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said eagerly.
Harry stared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been about to say, ``I suppose you want to know when the next D.A. meetingis?'' but her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) response did not seem to fit.
``I - er --'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
``Oh, its okay if you dont,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, looking mortified. ``Dont worry. I - Ill see you around.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) walked away. Harry stood staring after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain working frantically. Then something
clunked into place.
``Cho! Hey - CHO!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) halfway up the marble staircase.
``Er - dyou want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valentines Day?''
``Oooh, yes!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, blushing crimson and beaming at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Right... well... thats settled then,'' said Harry, and feeling that the day was not going to be a
complete loss after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) headed off to the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon lessons, walking in a rather bouncy way himself.
By six oclock that evening, however, even the glow of having successfully asked out Cho
Chang could not lighten the ominous feelings that intensified with every step Harry took towards
Snapes office.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) paused outside the door when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached it, wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were almost anywhere else, then,
taking a deep breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knocked and entered.
The shadowy room was lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which slimy bits of
animals and plants were suspended in variously colored potions. In one corner stood the
cupboard full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry - not without reason - of robbing.
Harrys attention was drawn towards the desk, however, where a shallow stone basin engraved
with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight. Harry recognized it at once - it was
Dumbledores Pensieve. Wondering what on earth it was doing there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jumped when Snapes
cold voice came out of the shadows.
``Shut the door behind you, Potter.''
Harry did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was told, with the horrible feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was imprisoning himself. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
turned back into the room, Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair
opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) desk. Harry sat down and so did Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon
Harry, dislike etched in every line of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.
``Well, Potter, you know why you are here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``The Headmaster has asked me to teach you
Occlumency. I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than at Potions.''
``Right,'' said Harry tersely.
``This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,'' said Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes narrowed malevolently, ``but I
am still your teacher and you will therefore call me sir or professor at all times.''
``Yes... sir,'' said Harry.
Snape continued to survey him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) through narrowed eyes for a moment, then said, ``Now,
Occlumency. As I told you back in your dear godfathers kitchen, this branch of magic seals the
mind against magical intrusion and influence.''
``And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, sir?'' said Harry, looking directly into
Snapes eyes and wondering whether Snape would answer.
Snape looked back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) for a moment and then said contemptuously, ``Surely even you could
have worked that out by now, Potter? The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency -''
``Whats that? Sir?''
``It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another persons mind -''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) can read minds?'' said Harry quickly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) worst fears confirmed.
``You have no subtlety, Potter,'' said Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) dark eyes glittering. ``You do not understand fine
distinctions. It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion-maker.''
Snape paused for a moment, apparently to savor the pleasure of insulting Harry, before
continuing.
``Only Muggles talk of mind-reading. The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing, Potter - or at least, most minds are.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) smirked. ``It is true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, under certain
conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) presence without detection.''
Whatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind-reading to Harry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) didnt like the
sound of it at all.
``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could know what were thinking right now? Sir?''
``The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded
by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell
within them,'' said Snape. ``Time and space matter in magic, Potter. Eye contact is often essential
to Legilimency.''
``Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency?''
Snape eyed Harry, tracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) mouth with one long, thin finger as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) did so.
``The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter. The curse that failed to kill you seems to
have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord. The evidence suggests
that at times, when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable - when you are asleep, for instance
- you are sharing the Dark Lords thoughts and emotions. The Headmaster thinks it inadvisable
for this to continue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>) wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord.''
Harrys heart was pumping fast again. None of this added up.
``But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked abruptly. ``I dont like it much,
but its been useful, hasnt it? I mean... I saw that snake attack Mr. Weasley and if I hadnt,
Professor Dumbledore wouldnt have been able to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), would he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)? Sir?''
Snape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) finger. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) spoke
again, it was slowly and deliberately, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) weighed every word.
``It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until
very recently. Up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) emotions, and sharing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
thoughts, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) being any the wiser. However, the vision you had shortly before Christmas
-''
``The one with the snake and Mr. Weasley?''
``Do not interrupt me, Potter,'' said Snape in a dangerous voice. ``As I was saying, the vision you
had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lords
thoughts -''
``I saw inside the snakes head, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)!''
``I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter?''
But Harry did not care if Snape was angry; at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) seemed to be getting to the bottom of this
business; he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had moved forwards in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) chair so that, without realizing it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was perched on the
very edge, tense as though poised for flight.
``How come I saw through the snakes eyes if its Voldemorts thoughts Im sharing?''
``Do not say the Dark Lords name!'' spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
``Professor Dumbledore says his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) name,'' said Harry quietly.
``Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,'' Snape muttered. ``While he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) may feel secure
enough to use the name... the rest of us...'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skin.
``I just wanted to know,'' Harry began again, forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice back to politeness, ``why -''
``You seem to have visited the snakes mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that
particular moment,'' snarled Snape. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it, too.''
``And Vol-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) - realized I was there?''
``It seems so,'' said Snape coolly.
``How do you know?'' said Harry urgently. ``Is this just Professor Dumbledore guessing, or -?''
``I told you,'' said Snape, rigid in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) chair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes slits, ``to call me sir.''
``Yes, sir,'' said Harry impatiently, ``but how do you know -?''
``It is enough that we know,'' said Snape repressively. ``The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) thoughts and feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) might be able to
access your thoughts and feelings in return -''
``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) might try and make me do things?'' asked Harry. ``Sir?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) added hurriedly.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) might,'' said Snape, sounding cold and unconcerned. ``Which brings us back to Occlumency.''
Snape pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand from an inside pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) robes and Harry tensed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair, but
Snape merely raised the wand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hair.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) withdrew it, some silvery substance came away, stretching from temple to wand like a
thick gossamer strand, which broke as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) pulled the wand away from it and fell gracefully into
the Pensieve, where it swirled silvery-white, neither gas nor liquid. Twice more, Snape raised the
wand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin, then, without
offering any explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) behavior, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed it to a
shelf out of their way and returned to face Harry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand held at the ready.
``Stand up and take out your wand, Potter.''
Harry got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, feeling nervous. They faced each other with the desk between them.
``You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself in any other way you can
think of,'' said Snape.
``And what are you going to do?'' Harry asked, eyeing Snapes wand apprehensively.
``I am about to attempt to break into your mind,'' said Snape softly. ``We are going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse. You will find that similar powers are needed for this... brace yourself, now. Legilimens!''
Snape had struck before Harry was ready, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had even begun to summon any force of
resistance. The office swam in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes and vanished; image after image was racing
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) surroundings.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was five, watching Dudley riding a new red bicycle, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) heart was bursting with
jealousy... he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) was nine, and Ripper the bulldog was chasing him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) up a tree and the Dursleys were
laughing below on the lawn... he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) was sitting under the Sorting Hat, and it was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>)
would do well in Slytherin... Hermione was lying in the hospital wing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face covered with
thick black hair... a hundred Dementors were closing in on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) beside the dark lake... Cho
Chang was drawing nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) under the mistletoe...
``No,'' said a voice inside Harrys head, as the memory of Cho drew nearer, ``youre not watching
that, youre not watching it, its private -''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) felt a sharp pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) knee. Snapes office had come back into view and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
had fallen to the floor; one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) knees had collided painfully with the leg of Snapes desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
looked up at Snape, who had lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand and was rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wrist. There was an angry
weal there, like a scorch mark.
``Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex?'' asked Snape coolly.
``No,'' said Harry bitterly, getting up from the floor.
``I thought not,'' said Snape, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) closely. ``You let me get in too far. You lost control.''
``Did you see everything I saw?'' Harry asked, unsure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to hear the answer.
``Flashes of it,'' said Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) lip curling. ``To whom did the dog belong?''
``My Aunt Marge,'' Harry muttered, hating Snape.
``Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been,'' said Snape, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand once more. ``You managed to stop me eventually, though you wasted time and energy shouting. You must remain focused. Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand.''
``Im trying,'' said Harry angrily, ``but youre not telling me how!''
``Manners, Potter,'' said Snape dangerously. ``Now, I want you to close your eyes.''
Harry threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) a filthy look before doing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was told. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) did not like the idea of standing
there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes shut while Snape faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), carrying a wand.
``Clear your mind, Potter,'' said Snapes cold voice. ``Let go of all emotion...''
But Harrys anger at Snape continued to pound through his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) veins like venom. Let go of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
anger? He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) could as easily detach his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) legs...
``Youre not doing it, Potter... you will need more discipline than this... focus, now...''
Harry tried to empty his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind, tried not to think, or remember, or feel...
``Lets go again... on the count of three... one - two - three -Legilimens!''
A great black dragon was rearing in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father and mother were waving at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out
of an enchanted mirror... Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>)...
``NOOOOOOO!''
Harry was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain aching as though someone
had been trying to pull it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skull.
``Get up!'' said Snape sharply. ``Get up! You are not trying, you are making no effort. You are
allowing me access to memories you fear, handing me weapons!''
Harry stood up again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart thumping wildly as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had really just seen Cedric dead in
the graveyard. Snape looked paler than usual, and angrier, though not nearly as angry as Harry
was.
``I - am - making - an - effort,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said through clenched teeth.
``I told you to empty yourself of emotion!''
``Yeah? Well, Im finding that hard at the moment,'' Harry snarled.
``Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord!'' said Snape savagely. ``Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad
memories and allow themselves to be provoked so easily - weak people, in other words - they
stand no chance against his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) powers! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter!''
``I am not weak,'' said Harry in a low voice, fury now pumping through him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might attack Snape in a moment.
``Then prove it! Master yourself!'' spat Snape. ``Control your anger, discipline your mind! We
shall try again! Get ready, now! Legilimens!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was watching Uncle Vernon hammering the letterbox shut... a hundred Dementors were
drifting across the lake in the grounds towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)... he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was running along a windowless
passage with Mr. Weasley... they were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the
corridor... Harry expected to go through it... but Mr. Weasley led him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) off to the left, down a
flight of stone steps...
``I KNOW! I KNOW!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) was on all fours again on Snapes office floor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) scar was prickling unpleasantly, but the
voice that had just issued from his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) mouth was triumphant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) pushed himself up again to find
Snape staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand raised. It looked as though, this time, Snape had lifted the spell
before Harry had even tried to fight back.
``What happened then, Potter?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) asked, eyeing Harry intently.
``I saw - I remembered,'' Harry panted. ``Ive just realized...''
``Realized what?'' asked Snape sharply.
Harry did not answer at once; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was still savoring the moment of blinding realization as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months, without
once realizing that it was a real place. Now, seeing the memory again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew that all along he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had been dreaming about the corridor down which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had run with Mr. Weasley on the twelfth of
August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry; it was the corridor leading to the
Department of Mysteries and Mr. Weasley had been there the night that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) had been attacked by
Voldemorts snake.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) looked up at Snape.
``Whats in the Department of Mysteries?''
``What did you say?'' Snape asked quietly and Harry saw, with deep satisfaction, that Snape was
unnerved.
``I said, whats in the Department of Mysteries, sir?'' Harry said.
``And why,'' said Snape slowly, ``would you ask such a thing?''
``Because'' said Harry, watching Snapes face closely, ``that corridor Ive just seen - Ive been dreaming about it for months -- Ive just recognized it - it leads to the Department of Mysteries... and I think Voldemort wants something from --''
``I have told you not to say the Dark Lords name!''
They glared at each other. Harrys scar seared again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) did not care. Snape looked agitated;
but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) spoke again he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) sounded as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was trying to appear cool and unconcerned.
``There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, few of which you would
understand and none of which concern you. Do I make myself plain?''
``Yes,'' Harry said, still rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) prickling scar, which was becoming more painful.
``I want you back here same time on Wednesday. We will continue work then.''
``Fine,'' said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was desperate to get out of Snapes office and find Ron and Hermione.
``You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep; empty it, make it blank and
calm, you understand?''
``Yes,'' said Harry, who was barely listening.
``And be warned, Potter... I shall know if you have not practiced''
``Right,'' Harry mumbled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) schoolbag, swung it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder and hurried
towards the office door. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced back at Snape, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) back to Harry
and was scooping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and replacing
them carefully inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own head. Harry left without another word, closing the door carefully
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar still throbbing painfully.
Harry found Ron and Hermione in the library, where they were working on Umbridges most
recent ream of homework. Other students, nearly all of them fifth-years, sat at lamp-lit tables
nearby, noses close to books, quills scratching feverishly, while the sky outside the mullioned
windows grew steadily blacker. The only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of Madam
Pinces shoes, as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly, breathing down the necks of those
touching her (<font color='blue'><b>librarian</b></font>) precious books.
Harry felt shivery; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar was still aching, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt almost feverish.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat down opposite Ron and Hermione, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) caught sight of himself in the window
opposite; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was very white and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual.
``How did it go?'' Hermione whispered, and then, looking concerned. ``Are you all right, Harry?''
``Yeah... fine... I dunno,'' said Harry impatiently, wincing as pain shot through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar again. ``Listen... Ive just realized something''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told them what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just seen and deduced.
``So... so are you saying...'' whispered Ron, as Madam Pince swept past, squeaking slightly, ``that the weapon - the thing You-Know-Whos after -- is in the Ministry of Magic?''
``In the Department of Mysteries, its got to be,'' H arry whispered. ``I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and its definitely the same one he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) was guarding when the snake bit him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>).''
Hermione let out a long, slow sigh.
``Of course,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) breathed.
``Of course what?'' said Ron rather impatiently.
``Ron, think about it... Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of
Magic... it must have been that one, its too much of a coincidence!''
``How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s on our side?'' said Ron.
``Well, I dont know,'' Hermione admitted. ``That is a bit odd...''
``So whats in the Department of Mysteries?'' Harry asked Ron. ``Has your dad ever mentioned
anything about it?''
``I know they call the people who work in there Unspeakables,``said Ron, frowning. ``Because no one really seems to know what they do - weird place to have a weapon.''
``Its not weird at all, it makes perfect sense,'' said Hermione. ``It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect... Harry, are you sure youre all right?''
For Harry had just run both his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands hard over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead as though trying to iron it.
``Yeah... fine...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands, which we re trembling. ``I just feel a bit... I dont
like Occlumency much.''
``I expect anyone would feel shaky if theyd had their mind attacked over and over again,'' said
Hermione sympathetically. ``Look, lets get back to the common room, well be a bit more
comfortable there.''
But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement; Fred and
George were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise.
``Headless Hats!'' shouted George, as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink
feather at the watching students. ``Two Galleons each, watch Fred, now!''
Fred swept the hat on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) head, beaming. For a second he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) merely looked rather stupid; then
both hat and head vanished.
Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter.
``And off again!'' shouted George, and Freds hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be
thin air over his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) shoulder; then his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) head reappeared as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) swept the pink-feathered hat from it.
``How do those hats work, then?'' said Hermione, distracted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) homework and watching
Fred and George closely. ``I mean, obviously its some kind of Invisibility Spell, but its rather
clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object...
Id imagine the charm wouldnt have a very long life though.''
Harry did not answer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was feeling ill.
``Im going to have to do this tomorrow,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttered, pushing the books he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just taken out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag back inside it.
``Well, write it in your homework planner then!'' said Hermione encouragingly. ``So you dont
forget!''
Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag, withdrew the planner and opened it
tentatively.
``Dont leave it till later, you big second-rater!'' chided the book as Harry scribbled down
Umbridges homework. Hermione beamed at it.
``I think Ill go to bed,'' said Harry, stuffing the homework planner back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried to put a Headless Hat on him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),
and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys dormitories. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was feeling
sick again, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had the night he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had had the vision of the snake, but thought that if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could
just lie down for a while he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would be all right.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) opened the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dormitory and was one step inside it when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) experienced pain so
severe he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not know where
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was standing or lying down, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not even know his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own name.
Maniacal laughter was ringing in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ears... he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was happier than he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been in a very long
time... jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant... a wonderful, wonderful thing had happened...
``Harry? HARRY!''
Someone had hit him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) around the face. The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain.
The happiness was draining out of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), but the laughter continued...
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own mouth. The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) realized this, it died away; Harry lay panting on the floor, staring
up at the ceiling, the scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead throbbing horribly. Ron was bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), looking
very worried.
``What happened?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said.
``I... dunno...'' Harry gasped, sitting up again. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s really happy... really happy...''
``You-Know-Who is?''
``Something goods happened,'' mumbled Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was shaking as badly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done after
seeing the snake attack Mr. Weasley and felt very sick. ``Something he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s been hoping for.''
The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger
was speaking them through Harrys mouth, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew they were true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took deep breaths,
willing himself not to vomit all over Ron. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here
to watch this time.
``Hermione told me to come and check on you,'' said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
feet. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) says your Defenses will be low at the moment, after Snapes been fiddling around with
your mind... still, I suppose itll help in the long run, wont it?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked doubtfully at Harry as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed. Harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
pillows, aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar still
prickling painfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not help feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first foray into Occlumency had weakened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) minds resistance rather than strengthening it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wondered, with a feeling of great
trepidation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had been in fourteen
years.
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
The Beetle at Bay
Harrys question was answered the very next morning. When Hermiones DailyProphet arrived
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) smoothed it out, gazed for a moment at the front page and gave a yelp that caused everyone
in the vicinity to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
``What?'' said Harry and Ron together.
For an answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten blackand- white photographs that filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards faces and the tenth, a witchs. Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; others were
tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures, looking insolent. Each picture was captioned
with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban.
Antonin Dolohov, read the legend beneath a wizard with a long, pale, twisted face who was
sneering up at Harry, convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett.
Augustus Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was
leaning against the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picture, looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic
secrets to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
But Harrys eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) face had leapt out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) the
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen the page. She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) had long, dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the
picture, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen it sleek, thick and shining. She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) glared up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) through heavily
lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) thin mouth. Like Sirius, she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)
retained vestiges of great good looks, but something - perhaps Azkaban - had taken most of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)
beauty.
Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice
Longbottom.
Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures, which Harry,
concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read.
MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN
MINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS RALLYING POINT FOR OLD DEATH EATERS
``Black?'' said Harry loudly. ``Not -?''
``Shh!'' whispered Hermione desperately. ``Not so loud - just read it!''
The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from
Azkaban.
Speaking to reporters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) private office, Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, confirmed that
ten high-security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) has
already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals.
``We find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the same position we were two and a half years ago
when the murderer Sirius Black escaped,'' said Fudge last night. ``Nor do we think the two
breakouts are unrelated. An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help, and we must
remember that Black, as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban, would be ideally placed to
help others follow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) footsteps. We think it likely that these individuals, who include Blacks
cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black as their leader. We are, however, doing all we can to round up the criminals, and we beg the magical community to remain alert and
cautious. On no account should any of these individuals be approached.''
``There you are, Harry,'' said Ron, looking awestruck. ``Thats why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was happy last night.''
``I dont believe this,'' snarled Harry, ``Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius?''
``What other options does he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) have?'' said Hermione bitterly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can hardly say, everyone,
Dumbledore warned me this might happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort -
stop whimpering, Ron - now Voldemorts worst supporters have broken out, too. I mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s
spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars, hasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)?''
Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while Harry looked
around the Great Hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not understand why his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fellow students were not looking scared
or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of them took the
newspaper every day like Hermione. There they all were, talking about homework and Quidditch
and who knew what other rubbish, when outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen
Voldemorts ranks.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) glanced up at the staff table. It was a different story there: Dumbledore and Professor
McGonagall were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave. Professor Sprout had
the Prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such
concentration that she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) lap from her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
stationary spoon. Meanwhile, at the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a
bowl of porridge. For once her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) pouchy toads eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for
misbehaving students. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) scowled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) gulped down her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) food and every now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so
intently.
``Oh my -'' said Hermione wonderingly, still staring at the newspaper.
``What now?'' said Harry quickly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was feeling jumpy.
``Its... horrible,'' said Hermione, looking shaken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) fold ed back page ten of the newspaper and handed it to Harry and Ron.
TRAGIC DEMISE OF MINISTRY OF MAGIC WORKER
St. Mungos Hospital promised a full inquiry last night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderick Bode, 49, was discovered dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Broderick</b></font>) bed, strangled by a potted-plant. Healers called to the scene were unable to revive Mr. Bode, who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bode</b></font>) death.
Healer Miriam Strout, who was in charge of Mr. Bodes ward at the time of the incident, has been
suspended on full pay and was unavailable for comment yesterday, but a spokeswizard for the
hospital said in a statement:
``St. Mungos deeply regrets the death of Mr. Bode, whose health was improving steadily prior to
this tragic accident.
``We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that Healer
Strout, busy over the Christmas period, overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr. Bodes
bedside table. As his (<font color='blue'><b>Bode</b></font>) speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to look
after the plant himself, unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom, but a cutting of Devils
Snare which, when touched by the convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him (<font color='blue'><b>Bode</b></font>) instantly.
``St. Mungos is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any
witch or wizard with information to come forward.''
``Bode...'' said Ron. ``Bode. It rings a bell...''
``We saw him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>),'' Hermione whispered. ``In St. Mungos, remember? He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) was in the bed opposite
Lockharts, just lying there, staring at the ceiling. And we saw the Devils Snare arrive. She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) - the
Healer - said it was a Christmas present.''
Harry looked back at the story. A feeling of horror was rising like bile in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat.
``How come we didnt recognize Devils Snare? Weve seen it before... we couldve stopped this
from happening.''
``Who expects Devils Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a pot plant?'' said Ron sharply.
``Its not our fault, whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame! They must be a real prat, why didnt
they check what they were buying?''
``Oh, come on, Ron!'' said Hermione shakily. ``I dont think anyone could put Devils Snare in a
pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it? This - this was murder... a clever murder,
as well... if the plant was sent anonymously, hows anyone ever going to find out who did it?''
Harry was not thinking about Devils Snare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was remembering taking the lift down to the
ninth level of the Ministry on the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hearing and the sallow-faced man who had got in on
the. Atrium level.
``I met Bode,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said slowly. ``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) at the Ministry with your dad.''
Rons mouth fell open.
``Ive heard Dad talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) at home! He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) was an Unspeakable - he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) worked in the Department
of Mysteries!''
They looked at each other for a moment, then Hermione pulled the newspaper back towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>),
closed it, glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front, then
leapt to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet.
``Where are you going?'' said Ron, startled.
``To send a letter,'' said Hermione, swinging her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shoulder. ``It... well, I dont know
whether... but its worth trying... and Im the only one who can.''
``I hate it when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does that,'' grumbled Ron, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and Harry got up from the table and made
their own, slower way out of the Great Hall. ``Would it kill her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to tell us what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)s up to for
once? Itd take her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) about ten more seconds - hey, Hagrid!''
Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the Entrance Hall, waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws
to pass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was still as heavily bruised as he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had been on the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had come back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)
mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) nose.
``All righ, you two?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) said, trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained
grimace.
``Are you okay, Hagrid?'' asked Harry, following him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lumbered after the Ravenclaws.
``Fine, fine,'' said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) waved a hand and narrowly
missed concussing a frightened-looking Professor Vector, who was passing. ``Jus busy, yeh
know, usual stuff lessons ter prepare - couple o salamanders got scale rot - an Im on
probation,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) mumbled.
``Youre on probation?'' said Ron very loudly, so that many of the passing students looked around curiously. ``Sorry - I mean - youre on probation?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) whispered.
``Yeah,'' said Hagrid. ``Sno moren I expected, ter tell yeh the truth. Yeh migh notve picked up
on it, bu that inspection didn go too well, yeh know... anyway,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sighed deeply. ``Bes go an
rub a bit more chilli powder on them salamanders or their tailsll be hangin off em next. See
yeh, Harry... Ron...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) trudged away, out of the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds. Harry
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) go, wondering how much more bad news he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could stand.
The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over
the next few days, but to Harrys indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it;
indeed, some people, Draco Malfoy prominent among them, seemed positively gleeful. As for
the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St. Mungos, Harry, Ron
and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared. There was only one topic of
conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered
through the school from those few people who read the newspapers. Rumors were flying that
some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to be hiding out in
the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had
once done.
Those who came from wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters
spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemorts; the crimes they had committed during the days
of Voldemorts reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives of their victims among the
Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of
reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, whose uncle, aunt and cousins had all
died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) now had a good
idea what it felt like to be Harry.
``And I dont know how you stand it - its horrible,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) said bluntly, dumping far too much
dragon manure on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) tray of Screechsnap seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in
discomfort.
It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors
these days, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers voices.
They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) overheard
snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophets
version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of the Azkaban fortress. In
their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation
available to them: the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous
year.
It was not only the students mood that had changed. It was now quite common to come across
two or three teachers conversing in low, urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their
conversations the moment they saw students approaching.
``They obviously cant talk freely in the staff room any more,'' said Hermione in a low voice, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), Harry and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout huddled together outside
the Charms classroom one day. ``Not with Umbridge there.''
``Reckon they know anything new?'' said Ron, gazing back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) shoulder at the three teachers.
``If they do, were not going to hear about it, are we?'' said Harry angrily. ``Not after Decree...
what number are we on now?'' For new notices had appeared on the house noticeboards the
morning after news of the Azkaban breakout:
BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOROF HOGWARTS
Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any information that is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach.
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-six.
Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge, High Inquisitor
This latest Decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students. Lee
Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was not allowed to tell
Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class.
``Exploding Snaps got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor! Thats not
information relating to your subject!''
When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand was bleeding rather badly. Harry recommended
essence of Murtlap.
Harry had thought the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under the nose of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) beloved
Fudge. It seemed, however, to have only intensified her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) furious desire to bring every aspect of
life at Hogwarts under her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) personal control. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) seemed determined at the very least to achieve a
sacking before long, and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or
Hagrid who went first.
Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was now conducted in the
presence of Umbridge and her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower
room, interrupting Professor Trelawneys increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions
about ornithomancy and heptomology, insisting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) predicted students answers before they
gave them and demanding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) demonstrate her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves and the
rune stones in turn. Harry thought Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain.
Several times he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) in the corridors - in itself a very unusual occurrence as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) generally
remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) tower room - muttering wildly to herself, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hands and shooting
terrified glances over her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) shoulder, and all the while giving off a powerful smell of cooking
sherry. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not been so worried about Hagrid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have felt sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) - but if one
of them was to be ousted from their job, there could be only one choice for Harry as to who
should remain.
Unfortunately, Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney.
Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed to be following Hermiones advice and had shown them nothing more
frightening than a Crup -- a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for its
forked tail - since before Christmas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) too seemed to have lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) nerve. He (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was oddly
distracted and jumpy during lessons, losing the thread of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was saying to the class,
answering questions wrongly, and all the time glancing anxiously at Umbridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was also
more distant with Harry, Ron and Hermione than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ever been before, and had expressly
forbidden them to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) after dark.
``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) catches yeh, itll be all of our necks on the line,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that might jeoparize his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) job further they abstained from walking down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hut in the evenings.
It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) of everything that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life at
Hogwarts worth living: visits to Hagrids house, letters from Sirius, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) Firebolt and Quidditch.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) revenge the only way he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could - by redoubling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) efforts for the D.A..
Harry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred on to work
harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody
was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville. The news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) parents attackers
escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had not once
mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) meeting with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungos and,
taking their lead from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said anything on the
subject of Bellatrix and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) fellow torturers escape. In fact, Neville barely spoke during the D.A.
meetings any more, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and counter-curse Harry taught
them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents
and working harder than anyone else in the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was improving so fast it was quite
unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm - a means of deflecting minor jinxes so
that they rebounded upon the attacker - only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville.
Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as Neville
was making during the D.A. meetings. Harrys sessions with Snape, which had started badly
enough, were not improving. On the contrary Harry felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was getting worse with every lesson.
Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had started studying Occlumency, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar had prickled occasionally, usually during
the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of Voldemorts thoughts or mood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)
experienced every now and then. Nowadays, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) scar hardly ever stopped prickling,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)
scar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had the horrible impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was
tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemorts mood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) could date this increased
sensitivity firmly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) first Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was now
dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the Department of Mysteries
almost every night, dreams which always culminated in him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) standing longingly in front of the
plain black door.
``Maybe its a bit like an illness,'' said Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
and Ron. ``A fever or something. It has to get worse before it gets better.''
``The lessons with Snape are making it worse,'' said Harry flatly. ``Im getting sick of my scar
hurting and Im getting bored with walking down that corridor every night.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
forehead angrily. ``I just wish the door would open, Im sick of standing staring at it -''
``Thats not funny,'' said Hermione sharply. ``Dumbledore doesnt want you to have dreams about
that corridor at all, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wouldnt have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. Youre just going
to have to work a bit harder in your lessons.''
``I am working!'' said Harry nettled. ``You try it some time - Snape trying to get inside your head - its not a bundle of laughs, you know!''
``Maybe...'' said Ron slowly.
``Maybe what?'' said Hermione, rather snappishly.
``Maybe its not Harrys fault he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cant close his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind,'' said Ron darkly.
``What do you mean?'' said Hermione.
``Well, maybe Snape isnt really trying to help Harry...''
Harry and Hermione stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other.
``Maybe,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said again, in a lower voice, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s actually trying to open Harrys mind a bit wider... make it easier for You-Know --''
``Shut up, Ron,'' said Hermione angrily. ``How many times have you suspected Snape, and when
have you ever been right? Dumbledore trusts him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) works for the Order, that ought to be
enough.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) used to be a Death Eater,'' said Ron stubbornly. ``And weve never seen proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) really
swapped sides.''
``Dumbledore trusts him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>),'' Hermione repeated. ``And if we cant trust Dumbledore, we cant trust
anyone.''
With so much to worry about and so much to do - startling amounts of homework that frequently
kept the fifth-years working until past midnight, secret D.A. sessions and regular classes with
Snape - January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast. Before Harry knew it, February had
arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade
visit of the year. Harry had had very little time to spare for conversations with Cho since they
had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found himself facing a Valentines Day
spent entirely in her (<font color='blue'><b>D.A.</b></font>) company.
On the morning of the fourteenth he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) dressed particularly carefully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentine</b></font>) and Ron arrived at
breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls. Hedwig was not there - not that Harry had
expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) - but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as
they sat down.
``And about time! If it hadnt come today...'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, eagerly tearing open the envelope and
pulling out a small piece of parchment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes sped from left to right as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) read through the
message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face.
``Listen, Harry,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), ``this is really important. Do you think you could
meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday?''
``Well... I dunno,'' said Harry uncertainly. ``Cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day
with her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>). We never said what we were going to do.''
``Well, bring her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) along if you must,'' said Hermione urgently. ``But will you come?''
``Well... all right, but why?''
``I havent got time to tell you now, Ive got to answer this quickly.''
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hurried out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of toast in the
other.
``Are you coming?'' Harry asked Ron, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, looking glum.
``I cant come into Hogsmeade at all; Angelina wants a full days training. Like its going to help;
were the worst team Ive ever seen. You should see Sloper and Kirke, theyre pathetic, even
worse than I am.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heaved a great sigh. ``I dunno why Angelina wont just let me resign.''
``Its because youre good when youre on form, thats why,'' said Harry irritably.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found it very hard to be sympathetic to Rons plight, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) himself would have given
almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff. Ron seemed to have
noticed Harrys tone, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was
a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterwards. Ron departed
for the Quidditch pitch and Harry, after attempting to flatten his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair while staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the Entrance Hall to meet Cho, feeling
very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) a little to the side of the oak front doors, looking very pretty with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hair tied back in a long pony-tail. Harrys feet seemed to be too big for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was suddenly horribly aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms and how stupid they must look
swinging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sides.
``Hi,'' said Cho slightly breathlessly.
``Hi,'' said Harry.
They stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, ``Well - er -- shall we go, then?''
``Oh - yes...''
They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occasionally catching each others
eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking to each other. Harry was relieved when they reached the
fresh air, finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand about looking awkward. It was
a fresh, breezy sort of a day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium Harry glimpsed Ron and
Ginny skimming along over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was not up there with
them.
``You really miss it, dont you?'' said Cho.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) looked round and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>).
``Yeah,'' sighed Harry. ``I do.''
``Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third year?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Yeah,'' said Harry, grinning. ``You kept blocking me.''
``And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to,'' said Cho,
smiling reminiscently. ``I heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) got taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right?''
``Nah, it was Puddlemere United; I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) at the World Cup last year.''
``Oh, I saw you there, too, remember? We were on the same campsite. It was really good, wasnt
it?''
The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through
the gates. Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) - no more difficult, in fact,
than talking to Ron and Hermione - and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a
large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson.
``Potter and Chang!'' screeched Pansy, to a chorus of snide giggles. ``Urgh, Chang, I dont think
much of your taste... at least Diggory was good-looking!''
The girls sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back
at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing
else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>) feet.
``So... where dyou want to go?'' Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was
full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together
on the pavements.
``Oh... I dont mind,'' said Cho, shrugging. ``Urn... shall we just have a look in the shops or
something?''
They wandered towards Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window
and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached
and Harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters. The
poster, By Order of the Ministry of Magic, offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or
wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.
``Its funny, isnt it,'' said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters,
``remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade
looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no Dementors
anywhere...''
``Yeah,'' said Harry, tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes away from Bellatrix Lestranges face to glance up and down
the High Street. ``Yeah, that is weird.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasnt sorry that there were no Dementors nearby, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came to think of it, their
absence was highly significant. They had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they werent
bothering to look for them... it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now.
The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Cho passed. It
started to rain as they passed Scrivenshafts; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harrys face
and the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck.
``Um... dyou want to get a coffee?'' said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily.
``Yeah, all right,'' said Harry, looking around. ``Where?''
``Oh, theres a really nice place just up here; havent you ever been to Madam Puddifoots?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
said brightly, leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed
before. It was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated
with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbridges office.
``Cute, isnt it?'' said Cho happily.
``Er... yeah,'' said Harry untruthfully.
``Look, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s decorated it for Valentines Day!'' said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs
that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti
over the occupants.
``Aaah...''
They sat down at the last remaining table, which was over by the steamy window. Roger Davies,
the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde
girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when,
looking around the teashop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw that it was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding
hands. Perhaps Cho would expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand.
``What can I get you, mdears?'' said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black
bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Daviess with great difficulty.
``Two coffees, please,'' said Cho.
In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) girlfriend had started kissing
over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they wouldnt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt that Davies was setting a standard
with which Cho would soon expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) to compete. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) face growing hot and tried
staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) couldnt see the street outside. To
postpone the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) would have to look at Cho, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) stared up at the ceiling as though
examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering
cherub.
After a few more painful minutes, Cho mentioned Umbridge. Harry seized on the subject with
relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), but the subject had already been so
thoroughly canvassed during D.A. meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell again. Harry wasvery conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around forsomething else to say.
``Er... listen, dyou want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime? Im meeting
Hermione Granger there.''
Cho raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) eyebrows.
``Youre meeting Hermione Granger? Today?''
``Yeah. Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>) asked me to, so I thought I would. Dyou want to come with me? She (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>) said it
wouldnt matter if you did.''
``Oh... well... that was nice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>).''
But Cho did not sound as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) thought it was nice at all. On the contrary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) tone was
cold and all of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) looked rather forbidding.
A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) coffee so fast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would soon
need a fresh cup. Beside them, Roger Davies and his (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) girlfriend seemed glued together at the lips.
Chos hand was lying on the table beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) coffee and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure
to take hold of it. Just do it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told himself, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged
up inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest, just reach out and grab it. Amazing, how much more difficult it was to extend
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm twelve inches and touch her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) hand than it was to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair...
But just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand forwards, Cho took hers off the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) was now watching
Roger Davies kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) girlfriend with a mildly interested expression.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>) asked me out, you know,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) said in a quiet voice. ``A couple of weeks ago. Roger. I turned
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) down, though.''
Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sudden lunging movement across the table,
could not think why she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) this. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) were sitting at the next table
being heartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) agreed to come out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>)?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them; some of it landed in
the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink.
``I came in here with Cedric last year,'' said Cho.
In the second or so it took for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) to take in what she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) had said, Harrys insides had become
glacial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not believe she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples
surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads.
Chos voice was rather higher when she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) spoke again.
``Ive been meaning to ask you for ages... did Cedric - did he (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) - m - m - mention me at all before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) died?''
This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with Cho.
``Well - no -'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) said quietly. ``There - there wasnt time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cedric</b></font>) to say anything. Erm... so...
dyou... dyou get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays? You support the Tornados, right?''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) horror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) eyes were swimming
with tears again, just as they had been after the last D.A. meeting before Christmas.
``Look,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) said desperately, leaning in so that nob ody else could overhear, ``lets not talk about
Cedric right now... lets talk about something else.''
But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.
``I thought,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) said, tears spattering down on to the table, ``I thought youd u - u - understand!
I need to talk about it! Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too! I mean, you saw it happen, d -
didnt you?''
Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Daviess girlfriend had even unglued herself
to look round at Cho crying.
``Well - I have talked about it,'' Harry said in a whisper, ``to Ron and Hermione, but -''
``Oh, youll talk to Hermione Granger!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) said shrilly, her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) face now shining with tears. Several
more kissing couples broke apart to stare. ``But you wont talk to me! P - perhaps it would be best if we just... just p - paid and you went and met up with Hermione G - Granger, like you
obviously want to!''
Harry stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>), utterly bewildered, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) shining
face with it.
``Cho?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said weakly, wishing Roger would seize his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) girlfriend and start kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) again to
stop her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) goggling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and Cho.
``Go on, leave!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) said, now crying into the napkin. ``I dont know why you asked me out in the
first place if youre going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me... how many
are you meeting after Hermione?''
``Its not like that!'' said Harry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so relieved at finally understanding what she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) was
annoyed about that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) laughed, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized a split second too late was also a mistake.
Cho sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) feet. The whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now.
``Ill see you around, Harry'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) said dramatically, and hiccoughing slightly she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) dashed to the
door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain.
``Cho!'' Harry called after her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>), but the door had already swung shut behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) with a tuneful
tinkle.
There was total silence within the teashop. Every eye was on Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) threw a Galleon down on
to the table, shook pink confetti out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair, and followed Cho out of the door.
It was raining hard now and she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) was nowhere to be seen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) simply did not understand what had
happened; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine.
``Women!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed street with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>)
pockets. ``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) want to talk about Cedric for, anyway? Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) always want to
drag up a subject that makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) act like a human hosepipe?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) was turning into the doorway
of the Three Broomsticks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) was too early to meet Hermione, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) thought it likely
there would be someone in here with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) could spend the intervening time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>)
wet hair out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) eyes and looked around. Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose.
``Hi, Hagrid!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>).
Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) barely recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Harry saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had two fresh cuts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face and several new bruises.
``Oh, its yeh, Harry,'' said Hagrid. ``Yeh all right?''
``Yeah, Im fine,'' lied Harry; but, next to this battered and mournful-looking Hagrid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
didnt really have much to complain about. ``Er - are you okay?''
``Me?'' said Hagrid. ``Oh yeah, Im grand, Harry, grand.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gazed into the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pewter tankard, which was the size of a large bucket, and sighed.
Harry didnt know what to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). They sat side by side in silence for a moment. Then
Hagrid said abruptly, ``In the same boat, yeh an me, aren we, Arry?''
``Er -'' said Harry.
``Yeah... Ive said it before... both outsiders, like,'' said Hagrid, nodding wisely. ``An both
orphans. Yeah... both orphans.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a great swig from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tankard.
``Makes a diffrence, havin a decent family,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``Me dad was decent. An your mum an
dad were decent. If theyd lived, life woulda bin diffrent, eh?''
``Yeah... I spose,'' said Harry cautiously. Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood.
``Family,'' said Hagrid gloomily. ``Whatever yeh say, bloods important...''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wiped a trickle of it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye.
``Hagrid,'' said Harry, unable to stop himself, ``where are you getting all these injuries?''
``Eh?'' said Hagrid, looking startled. ``Wha injuries?''
``All those!'' said Harry, pointing at Hagrids face.
``Oh... thas jus normal bumps an bruises, Harry,'' said Hagrid dismissively, ``I got a rough job.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) drained his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tankard, set it back on the table and got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet.
``Ill be seein yeh, Harry... take care now.''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lumbered out of the pub looking wretched, and disappeared into the torrential rain. Harry
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) go, feeling miserable. Hagrid was unhappy and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was hiding something, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
seemed determined not to accept help. What was going on? But before Harry could think about it
any further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard a voice calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) name.
``Harry! Harry, over here!''
Hermione was waving at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from the other side of the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got up and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) through the crowded pub. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was still a few tables away when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized that
Hermione was not alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter, ex-journalist on
the Daily Prophet and one of Hermiones least favorite people in the world.
``Youre early!'' said Hermione, moving along to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) room to sit down. ``I thought you were
with Cho, I wasnt expecting you for another hour at least!''
``Cho?'' said Rita at once, twisting round in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) seat to stare avidly at Harry. ``A girl?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) snatched up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it.
``Its none of your business if Harrys been with a h undred girls,'' Hermione told Rita coolly. ``So you can put that away right now.''
Rita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid-green quill from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) bag. Looking as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) had been forced to swallow Stinksap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) snapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) bag shut again.
``What are you up to?'' Harry asked, sitting down and staring from Rita to Luna to Hermione.
``Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,'' said Rita, taking a large slurp of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) drink. ``I suppose Im allowed to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), am I?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) shot at Hermione.
``Yes, I suppose you are,'' said Hermione coldly.
Unemployment did not suit Rita. The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung
lank and unkempt around her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face. The scarlet paint on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) two-inch talons was chipped and
there were a couple of false jewels missing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) winged glasses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) took another great gulp
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) drink and said out of the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth, ``Pretty girl, is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Harry?''
``One more word about Harrys love life and the deals off and thats a promise,'' said Hermione
irritably.
``What deal?'' said Rita, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand. ``You havent mentioned a
deal yet, Miss Prissy, you just told me to turn up. Oh, one of these days...'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) took a deep
shuddering breath.
``Yes, yes, one of these days youll write more horrible stories about Harry and me,'' said
Hermione indifferently. ``Find someone who cares, why dont you?''
``Theyve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help,'' said Rita,
shooting a sideways look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) over the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) glass and adding in a rough whisper, ``How
has that made you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feels angry, of course,'' said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. ``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s told the Minister
for Magic the truth and the Ministers too much of an idiot to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>).''
``So you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?'' said Rita,
lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) finger strayed longingly to
the clasp of the crocodile bag. ``You stand by all this garbage Dumbledores been telling
everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness?''
``I wasnt the sole witness,'' snarled Harry. ``There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well.
Want their names?''
``Id love them,'' breathed Rita, now fumbling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) bag once more and gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was the most beautiful thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) had ever seen. ``A great bold headline: PotterAccuses...  A
sub-heading, Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us. And then, beneath a nice big
photograph of you, Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-Whosattack, Harry Potter, 15,
caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding
community of being Death Eaters... ''
The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) hand and halfway to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) mouth when the rapturous
expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) face died.
``But of course,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione, ``Little Miss
Perfect wouldnt want that story out there, would she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)?''
``As a matter of fact,'' said Hermione sweetly, ``thats exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.''
Rita stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>). So did Harry. Luna, on the other hand, sang Weasley is our King dreamily
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) breath and stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) drink with a cocktail onion on a stick.
``You want me to report what he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) says about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?``Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice.
``Yes, I do,'' said Hermione. ``The true story. All the facts. Exactly as Harry reports them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)ll
give you all the details, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)ll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw there,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)ll tell you what Voldemort looks like now - oh, get a grip on yourself,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) added
contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for, at the sound of Voldemorts name, Rita
had jumped so badly she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) had slopped half her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) glass of Firewhisky down herself.
Rita blotted the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said baldly,
``The Prophet wouldnt print it. In case you havent noticed, nobody believes his (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) cock-and-bull
story. Everyone thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>)s delusional. Now, if you let me write the story from that angle -''
``We dont need another story about how Harrys lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) marbles!'' said Hermione angrily.
``Weve had plenty of those already, thank you! I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) given the opportunity to tell the truth!''
``Theres no market for a story like that,'' said Rita coldly.
``You mean the Prophet wont print it because Fudge wont let them,'' said Hermione irritably.
Rita gave Hermione a long, hard look. Then, leaning forwards across the table towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>)
said in a businesslike tone, ``All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same
thing. They wont print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to read it. Its
against the public mood. This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough.
People just dont want to believe You-Know-Whos back.''
``So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it?'' said Hermione
scathingly.
Rita sat up straight again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) eyebrows raised, and drained her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) glass of Firewhisky.
``The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) said coldly.
``My dad thinks its an awful paper,'' said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly.
Sucking on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) cocktail onion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) gazed at Rita with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) enormous, protuberant, slightly mad
eyes. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) publishes important stories he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) thinks the public needs to know. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) doesnt care about
making money.''
Rita looked disparagingly at Luna.
``Im guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) said. ``Probably, Twenty- Five Ways to Mingle With Muggles and the dates of the next Bring and Fly Sale?''
``No,'' said Luna, dipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) onion back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) Gillywater, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)s the editor of The Quibbler.<div class="bookquote">''
Rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked round in alarm.
'' (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>Important stories he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) thinks the public needs to know, eh? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) said witheringly. ``I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag.''
``Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isnt it?'' said Hermione pleasantly. ``Luna
says her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) fathers quite happy to take Harrys interview. Thats wholl be publishing it.''
Rita stared at them both for a moment, then let out a great whoop of laughter.
``The Quibbler!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) said, cackling. ``You think people will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seriously if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s published
in The Quibbler!''
``Some people wont,'' said Hermione in a level voice. ``But the Daily Prophets version of the
Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it. I think a lot of people will be wondering whether
there isnt a better explanation of what happened, and if theres an alternative story available,
even if it is published in a -'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) glanced sideways at Luna, ``in a - well, an unusual magazine - I
think they might be rather keen to read it.''
Rita didnt say anything for a while, but eyed Hermione shrewdly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head a little to one side.
``All right, lets say for a moment Ill do it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said abruptly. ``What kind of fee am I going to
get?''
``I dont think Daddy exactly pays people to write f or the magazine,'' said Luna dreamily. ``They
do it because its an honor and, of course, to see their names in print.''
Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Skeeter</b></font>) mouth again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Skeeter</b></font>) rounded
on Hermione.
``Im supposed to do this for free?''
``Well, yes,'' said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) drink. ``Otherwise, as you very well know,
I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the Prophet might
give you rather a lot for an insiders account of life in Azkaban.''
Rita looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella
sticking out of Hermiones drink and thrust it up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) nose.
``I dont suppose Ive got any choice, have I?'' said Rita, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) voice shaking slightly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) opened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) crocodile bag once more, withdrew a piece of parchment, and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) Quick-Quotes Quill.
``Daddy will be pleased,'' said Luna brightly. A muscle twitched in Ritas jaw.
``Okay, Harry?'' said Hermione, turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>). ``Ready to tell the public the truth?''
``I suppose,'' said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the
parchment between them.
``Fire away, then, Rita,<div class="bookquote">'' said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
glass.
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
Seen and Unforeseen
Luna said vaguely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) did not know how soon Ritas interview with Harry would appear
in The Quibbler, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) father was expecting a '' (<font color='red'><b>Rita/Rita Skeeter</b></font>)</div>lovely long article on recent sightings of
Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,''- ``and of course, thatll be a very important story, so Harrys might
have to wait for the following issue,'' said Luna.
Harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when Voldemort had returned.
Rita had pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) for every little detail and he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) could remember,
knowing that this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) one big opportunity to tell the world the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) wondered how
people would react to the story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was completely insane, not least because his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish
about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) fellow Death
Eaters had given Harry a burning desire to dosomething, whether or not it worked...
``Cant wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public,'' said Dean, sounding awestruck at
dinner on Monday night. Seamus was shoveling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on
Deans other side, but Harry knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was listening.
``Its the right thing to do, Harry,'' said Neville, who was sitting opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, ``It must have been... tough... talking about it... was it?''
``Yeah,'' mumbled Harry, ``but people have got to know what Voldemorts capable of, havent
they?''
``Thats right,'' said Neville, nodding, ``and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Death Eaters, too... people should know...''
Neville left his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) sentence hanging and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) baked potato. Seamus looked up, but when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) caught Harrys eye he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) looked quickly back at his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) plate again. After a while, Dean, Seamus and
Neville departed for the common room, leaving Harry and Hermione at the table waiting for
Ron, who had not yet had dinner because of Quidditch practice.
Cho Chang walked into the Hall with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) friend Marietta. Harrys stomach gave an unpleasant
lurch, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) did not look over at the Gryffindor table, and sat down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Oh, I forgot to ask you,'' said Hermione brightly, glancing over at the Ravenclaw table, ``what
happened on your date with Cho? How come you were back so early?''
``Er... well, it was...'' said Harry, pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and helping
himself to seconds, ``a complete fiasco, now you mention it.<div class="bookquote">''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) what had happened in Madam Puddifoots teashop.
'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>... so then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finished several minutes later, as the final bit of crumble disappeared, ``she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) jumps up, right, and says, Ill see you around, Harry, an d runs out of the place!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spoon and looked at Hermione. ``I mean, what was all that about? What was going on?''
Hermione glanced over at the back of Chos head and sighed.
``Oh, Harry'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said sadly. ``Well, Im sorry, but you were a bit tactless.''
``Me, tactless?'' said Harry, outraged. ``One minute we were getting on fine, next minute she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was
telling me that Roger Davies asked her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) out and how she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid
teashop - how was I supposed to feel about that?''
``Well, you see,'' said Hermione, with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one
equals two to an over-emotional toddler, ``you shouldnt have told her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) that you wanted to meet
me halfway through your date.''
``But, but,'' spluttered Harry, ``but - you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) along, how was I supposed to do that without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''
``You should have told her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) differently,'' said Hermione, still with that maddeningly patient air.
``You should have said it was really annoying, but Id made you promise to come along to the
Three Broomsticks, and you really didnt want to go, youd much rather spend the whole day
with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) please,
please come along with you and hopefully youd be able to get away more quickly. And it might
have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am, too,'' Hermione added as an
afterthought.
``But I dont think youre ugly,'' said Harry, bemused.
Hermione laughed.
``Harry youre worse than Ron... well, no, youre not, '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sighed, as Ron himself came
stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy. ``Look - you upset Cho when
you said you were going to meet me, so she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tried to make you jealous. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) way of trying to
find out how much you liked her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''
``Is that what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was doing?'' said Harry, as Ron dropped on to the bench opposite them and
pulled every dish within reach towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Well, wouldnt it have been easier if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)d just
asked me whether I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) better than you?''
``Girls dont often ask questions like that,'' said Hermione.
``Well, they should!'' said Harry forcefully. ``Then I couldve just told her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) I fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
wouldnt have had to get herself all worked up again about Cedric dying!''
``Im not saying what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did was sensible,'' said Hermione, as Ginny joined them, just as muddy as Ron and looking equally disgruntled. ``Im just trying to make you see how she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was feeling at the time.''
``You should write a book,'' Ron told Hermione as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) cut up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) potatoes, ``translating mad things
girls do so boys can understand them.''
``Yeah,'' said Harry fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table. Cho had just got up, and, still
not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) left the Great Hall. Feeling rather depressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) looked back at Ron and
Ginny. ``So, how was Quidditch practice?''
``It was a nightmare,'' said Ron in a surly voice.
``Oh come on,'' said Hermione, looking at Ginny, ``Im sure it wasnt that -''
``Yes, it was,'' said Ginny. ``It was appalling. Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it.''
Ron and Ginny went off for baths after dinner; Harry and Hermione returned to the busy
Gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework. Harry had been struggling with a
new star-chart for Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up.
``Ron and Ginny not here?'' asked Fred, looking around as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pulled up a chair, and when Harry
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, ``Good. We were watching their practice. Theyre going to be
slaughtered. Theyre complete rubbish without us.''
``Come on, Ginnys not bad,'' said George fairly, sitting down next to Fred. ``Actually, I dunno
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) got so good, seeing how we never let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) play with us.''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of
your brooms out in turn when you werent looking,'' said Hermione from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) tottering
pile of Ancient Rune books.
``Oh,'' said George, looking mildly impressed. ``Well - thatd explain it.''
``Has Ron saved a goal yet?'' asked Hermione, peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and
Logograms.
``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) can do it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) doesnt think anyones watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>),'' said Fred, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) eyes. ``So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the
Quaffle goes up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) end on Saturday.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) got up again and moved restlessly to the window, staring out across the dark grounds.
``You know, Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for.''
Hermione cast him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) a stern look.
``Youve got exams coming!''
``Told you already, were not fussed about NEWTs,'' said Fred. ``The Snackboxes are ready to
roll, we found out how to get rid of those boils, just a couple of drops of Murtlap essence sorts
them, Lee put us on to it.''
George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky.
``I dunno if I even want to watch this match. If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill
myself.''
``Kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), more like,'' said Fred firmly.
``Thats the trouble with Quidditch,'' said Hermione absent-mindedly, once again bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
Runes translation, ``it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked up to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) copy of Spellmans Syllabary, and caught Fred, George and Harry all
staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces.
``Well, it does!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said impatiently. ``Its only a game, isnt it?''
``Hermione,'' said Harry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, ``youre good on feelings and stuff, but you just dont
understand about Quidditch.''
``Maybe not,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said darkly, returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) translation, ``but at least my happiness doesnt
depend on Rons goalkeeping ability.''
And though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), by
the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had watched the game the following Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have given any number of
Galleons not to care about Quidditch either.
The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short; the Gryffindor
spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst
thing was: Harry thought it was a close-run contest between Rons fourteenth failed save, Sloper
missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) bat, and Kirke shrieking and
falling backwards off his (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) broom when Zacharias Smith zoomed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) carrying the Quaffle. The
miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from
right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerbys nose, so that the final score was two hundred and
forty versus two hundred and thirty.
``Good catch,'' Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that
of a particularly dismal funeral.
``I was lucky,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) shrugged. ``It wasnt a very fast Snitch and Summerbys got a cold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sneezed and closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes at exactly the wrong moment. Anyway, once youre back on the team -''
``Ginny, Ive got a lifelong ban.''
``Youre banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,'' Ginny corrected him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Theres a difference. Anyway, once youre back, I think Ill try out for Chaser. Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway.''
Harry looked over at Ron, who was hunched in a corner, staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees, a bottle of
Butterbeer clutched in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand.
``Angelina still wont let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) resign,'' Ginny said, as though reading Harrys mind. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>)
knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s got it in him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).''
Harry liked Angelina for the faith she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) was showing in Ron, but at the same time thought it would
really be kinder to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leave the team. Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of
Weasley is our King sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now favorites to win
the Quidditch Cup.
Fred and George wandered over.
``I havent even got the heart to take the mickey out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>),'' said Fred, looking over at Rons
crumpled figure. ``Mind you... when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) missed the fourteenth -<div class="bookquote">''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) made wild motions with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) arms as though doing an upright doggy-paddle.
'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>- well, Ill save it for parties, eh?''
Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this. Out of respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feelings, Harry waited a
while before going up to the dormitory himself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
wanted to. Sure enough, when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little too loudly
to be entirely plausible.
Harry got into bed, thinking about the match. It had been immensely frustrating watching from
the sidelines. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was quite impressed by Ginnys performance but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been
playing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could have caught the Snitch sooner... there had been a moment when it had been
fluttering near Kirkes ankle; if Ginny hadnt hesitated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) might have been able to scrape a win
for Gryffindor.
Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione. Once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had turned
squatly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) seat to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wide toads mouth stretched in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought had been a
gloating smile. The memory of it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feel hot with anger as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lay there in the dark. After
a few minutes, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was supposed to be emptying his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind of all
emotion before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slept, as Snape kept instructing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at the end of every Occlumency lesson.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely
increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) sense of grumbling resentment and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) found himself focusing instead on how much
he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) loathed the pair of them. Slowly, Rons snores died away, to be replaced by the sound of
deep, slow breathing. It took Harry much longer to get to sleep; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body was tired, but it took his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
brain a long time to close down.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement
while Professor McGonagall played the bagpipes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) watched them happily for a while, then
decided to go and find the other members of the D.A..
But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) left the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) found himself facing, not the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, but a
torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barnabas</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnabas</b></font>) head slowly to the left. There, at the
far end of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Barnabas</b></font>) walked towards it with a sense of mounting excitement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barnabas</b></font>) had the strangest feeling that this
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnabas</b></font>) was going to get lucky at last, and find the way to open it... he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnabas</b></font>) was feet from it, and saw
with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right-hand
side... the door was ajar... he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnabas</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnabas</b></font>) hand to push it wide and -
Ron gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore and Harry awoke abruptly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right hand stretched
in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the darkness, to open a door that was hundreds of miles away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) let it fall
with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should not have seen the door,
but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not
help feeling annoyed with Ron... if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could have saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) snore for just another minute.
They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on
Monday morning. Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) Daily Prophet: nearly
everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many reported
sightings, had still not been caught. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) gave the delivery owl a Knut and unfolded the
newspaper eagerly while Harry helped himself to orange juice; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had only received one note
during the entire year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sure, when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), that it
had made a mistake.
``Whore you after?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked it, languidly removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) orange juice from underneath its beak
and leaning forwards to see the recipients name and address:
Harry Potter, Great Hall, Hogwarts School
Frowning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) made to take the letter from the owl, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) could do so, three, four, five
more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter
and knocking over the salt as each one attempted to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) their letter first.
``Whats going on?'' Ron asked in amazement, as the whole of Gryffindor table leaned forwards
to watch and another seven owls landed amongst the first ones, screeching, hooting and flapping
their wings.
``Harry!'' said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a
screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package. ``I think I know what this means - open this one
first!''
Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled copy of the March edition
of The Quibbler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) unrolled it to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own face grinning sheepishly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from the front
cover. In large red letters across this picture were the words:
SPEAKS OUT AT LAST: THE TRUTH ABOUT HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED AND
THE NIGHT I SAW HIM RETURN
``Its good, isnt it?'' said Luna, who had drifted o ver to the Gryffindor table and now squeezed
herself on to the bench between Fred and Ron. ``It came out yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a
free copy. I expect all these,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on
the table in front of Harry, ``are letters from readers.''
``Thats what I thought,'' said Hermione eagerly. ``Harry, dyou mind if we -?''
``Help yourself,'' said Harry, feeling slightly bemused.
Ron and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes.
``This ones from a bloke who thinks youre off your rocker,'' said Ron, glancing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) letter.
``Ah well...''
``This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St. Mungos,'' said Hermione, looking disappointed and crumpling up a second.
``This one looks okay, though,'' said Harry slowly, scanning a long letter from a witch in Paisley.
``Hey, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) believes me!''
``This ones in two minds,'' said Fred, who had joined in the letter-opening with enthusiasm.
``Says you dont come across as a mad person, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mungo</b></font>) really doesnt want to believe You-Know-
Whos back so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mungo</b></font>) doesnt know what to think now. Blimey, what a waste of parchment.''
``Heres another one youve convinced, Harry!'' said Hermione excitedly. ``Having read your side
of the story, I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly...
little though I want to think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth... Oh, this is wonderful!''
``Another one who thinks youre barking,<div class="bookquote">'' said Ron, throwing a crumpled letter over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) shoulder
'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>... but this one says youve got her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) converted and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) now thinks youre a real hero - she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)s put
in a photograph, too - wow!''
``What is going on here?'' said a falsely sweet, girlish voice.
Harry looked up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands full of envelopes. Professor Umbridge was standing behind Fred
and Luna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) bulging toads eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of
Harry. Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw many of the students watching them avidly.
``Why have you got all these letters, Mr. Potter?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) asked slowly.
``Is that a crime now?'' said Fred loudly. ``Getting mail?''
``Be careful, Mr. Weasley, or I shall have to put you in detention,'' said Umbridge. ``Well, Mr.
Potter?''
Harry hesitated, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could keep what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done quiet; it was surely only
a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to Umbridges attention.
``People have written to me because I gave an interview,'' said Harry. ``About what happened to
me last June.''
For some reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced up at the staff table as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said this. Harry had the strangest feeling
that Dumbledore had been watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a second before, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked towards the
Headmaster he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick.
``An interview?'' repeated Umbridge, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice thinner and higher than ever. ``What do you
mean?''
``I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them,'' said Harry. ``Here -''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) threw the copy of The Quibbler to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) caught it and stared down at the cover. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
pale, doughy face turned an ugly, patchy violet.
``When did you do this?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) asked, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice trembling slightly.
``Last Hogsmeade weekend,'' said Harry.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), incandescent with rage, the magazine shaking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) stubby fingers.
``There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you, Mr. Potter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) whispered. ``How you dare...
how you could...'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) took a deep breath. ``I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell
lies. The message, apparently, has still not sunk in. Fifty points from Gryffindor and another
weeks worth of detentions.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) stalked away, clutching The Quibbler to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) chest, the eyes of many students following her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
By mid-morning enormous signs had been put up all over the school, not just on house
noticeboards, but in the corridors and classrooms too.
BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS
Any student found in possession of the magazine The Quibbler will be expelled.
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-seven.
Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge, High Inquisitor
For some reason, every time Hermione caught sight of one of these signs she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) beamed with
pleasure.
``What exactly are you so happy about?'' Harry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
``Oh, Harry, dont you see?'' Hermione breathed. ``If she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could have done one thing to make
absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview, it was banning
it!''
And it seemed that Hermione was quite right. By the end of the day, though Harry had not seen
so much as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school, the whole place seemed to be
quoting the interview to each other. Harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up
outside classes, discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons, while Hermione even
reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls toilets had been talking about it when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) nipped in there before Ancient Runes. ``Then they spotted me, and obviously they know I
know you, so they bombarded me with questions,'' Hermione told Harry, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes shining, ``and
Harry, I think they believe you, I really do, I think youve finally got them convinced!''
Meanwhile, Professor Umbridge was stalking the school, stopping students at random and
demanding that they turn out their books and pockets: Harry knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was looking for copies
of The Quibbler, but the students were several steps ahead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). The pages carrying Harrys
interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from textbooks if anyone but themselves read
it, or else wiped magically blank until they wanted to peruse it again. Soon it seemed that every
single person in the school had read it.
The teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational Decree
Number Twenty-six, but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same.
Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) a watering can; a
beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at the end of Charms,
said, ``Shh!'' and hurried away; and Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during
Divination and announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving Umbridge, that Harry
was not going to suffer an early death after all, but would live to a ripe old age, become Minister
for Magic and have twelve children.
But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was hurrying along to
Transfiguration the next day. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew what had happened, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hand was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
was breathing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ear, ``Im really, really sorry. That interview was so brave... it made me cry.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sorry to hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had shed even more tears over it, but very glad they were on speaking
terms again, and even more pleased when she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off
again. And unbelievably, no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arrived outside Transfiguration than something just as
good happened: Seamus stepped out of the queue to face him (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>).
``I just wanted to say,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) mumbled, squinting at Harrys left knee, ``I believe you. And Ive sent a copy of that magazine to me mam.''
If anything more was needed to complete Harrys happiness, it was the reaction he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got from
Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the
library; they were with a weedy-looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott.
They looked round at Harry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) browsed the shelves for the book he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) needed on Partial
Vanishment: Goyle cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered something
undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe. Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters.
``And the best bit,'' whispered Hermione gleefully, as they left the library, ``is they cant contradict you, because they cant admit theyve read the article!''
To cap it all, Luna told him (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) over dinner that no issue of The Quibbler had ever sold out faster.
``Dads reprinting!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) told Harry, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes popping excitedly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) cant believe it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) says
people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!''
Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night. Daringly, Fred and George had put
an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harrys giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like THE MINISTRY ARE MORONS and EAT DUNG, UMBRIDGE in a booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said it interfered with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) concentration, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) ended up going to bed early out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted
disconnected words like DUNG and UMBRIDGE at more and more frequent intervals in a
progressively higher voice. In fact, it started to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head ache and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar began prickling
uncomfortably again. To disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to relive his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) interview for the umpteenth time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) too needed
an early night.
The dormitory was empty when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead for a moment against the
cool glass of the window beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed; it felt soothing against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) undressed and
got into bed, wishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) headache would go away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) also felt slightly sick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rolled over on to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) side, closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, and fell asleep almost at once...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was standing in a dark, curtained room lit by a single branch of candles. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands were
clenched on the back of a chair in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). They were long-fingered and white as though
they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders against the dark velvet of
the chair.
Beyond the chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles, knelt a man in black robes.
``I have been badly advised, it seems,'' said Harry, in a high, cold voice that pulsed with anger.
``Master, I crave your pardon,'' croaked the man kneeling on the floor. The back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head
glimmered in the candlelight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed to be trembling.
``I do not blame you, Rookwood,'' said Harry in that cold, cruel voice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) relinquished his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grip on the chair and walked around it, closer to the man cowering on the
floor, until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood directly over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height
than usual.
``You are sure of your facts, Rookwood?'' asked Harry.
``Yes, My Lord, yes... I used to work in the Department after - after all...''
``Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.''
``Bode could never have taken it, Master... Bode would have known he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) could not... undoubtedly, that is why he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) fought so hard against Malfoys Imperius Curse...''
``Stand up, Rookwood,'' whispered Harry.
The kneeling man almost fell over in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) haste to obey. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was pockmarked; the scars were
thrown into relief by the candlelight. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained a little stooped when standing, as though
halfway through a bow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) darted terrified looks up at Harrys face.
``You have done well to tell me this,'' said Harry. ``Very well... I have wasted months on fruitless
schemes, it seems... but no matter... we begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemorts
gratitude, Rookwood...''
``My Lord... yes, My Lord,'' gasped Rookwood, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice hoarse with relief.
``I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give me.''
``Of course, My Lord, of course... anything...''
``Very well... you may go. Send Avery to me.''
Rookwood scurried backwards, bowing, and disappeared through a door.
Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned towards the wall. A cracked, age-spotted mirror hung
on the wall in the shadows. Harry moved towards it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reflection grew larger and clearer in the
darkness... a face whiter than a skull... red eyes with slits for pupils...
``NOOOOOOOOO!''
``What?'' yelled a voice nearby.
Harry flailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed. For a few
seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was about to see the white, skulllike face looming at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out of the dark again, then very near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Rons voice spoke.
``Will you stop acting like a maniac so I can get you out of here!''
Ron wrenched the hangings apart and Harry stared up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the moonlight, flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar searing with pain. Ron looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had just been getting ready for bed; one arm
was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) robes.
``Has someone been attacked again?'' asked Ron, pulling Harry roughly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. ``Is it Dad? Is it that snake?''
``No - everyones fine -'' gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as though it were on fire. ``Well...
Avery isnt... he (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>)s in trouble... he (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) the wrong information... Voldemorts really angry''
Harry groaned and sank, shaking, on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar.
``But Rookwoods going to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) now... he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s on the right track again...''
``What are you talking about?'' said Ron, sounding scared. ``Dyou mean... did you just see You-
Know-Who?''
``I was You-Know-Who,'' said Harry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands in the darkness and held
them up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, to check that they were no longer deathly white and long-fingered. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was
with Rookwood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban, remember? Rookwoods just told him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) Bode couldnt have done it.''
``Done what?''
``Remove something... he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) said Bode would have known he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) couldnt have done it... Bode was
under the Imperius Curse... I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) said Malfoys dad put it on him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>).''
``Bode was bewitched to remove something?'' Ron said. ``But -Harry, thats got to be -''
``The weapon,'' Harry finished the sentence for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``I know''
The dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in. Harry swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs back into bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened, seeing as Seamus had only just
stopped thinking Harry was a nutter.
``Did you say,'' murmured Ron, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head close to Harrys on the pretence of helping
himself to water from the jug on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedside table, ``that you were You-Know-Who?''
``Yeah,'' said Harry quietly.
Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water; Harry saw it spill over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chin on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest.
``Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off their robes and talking, ``youve got to tell -''
``I havent got to tell anyone,'' said Harry shortly. ``I wouldnt have seen it at all if I could do
Occlumency. Im supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out. Thats what they want.''
By they he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) meant Dumbledore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got back into bed and rolled over on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) side with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
back to Ron and after a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) heard Rons mattress creak as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), too, lay back down. Harrys
scar began to burn; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bit hard on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pillow to stop himself making a noise. Somewhere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
knew, Avery was being punished.
Harry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened;
they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard. Standing in their usual corner of
the cool and breezy courtyard, Harry told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) every detail of the dream he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could remember.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said nothing at all for a few moments, but stared with a kind of
painful intensity at Fred and George, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from
under their cloaks on the other side of the yard.
``So thats why they killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said quietly, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) gaze from Fred and George at
last. ``When Bode tried to steal this weapon, something funny happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). I think there must be defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people touching it. Thats why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in St.
Mungos, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain had gone all funny and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldnt talk. But remember what the Healer told
us? He (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) was recovering. And they couldnt risk him (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) getting better, could they? I mean, the shock
of whatever happened when he (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift.
Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>)d got his (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>) voice back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>)d explain what he (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>)d been doing, wouldnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>)? They would have
known he (<font color='blue'><b>Healer</b></font>)d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy
to put the curse on him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>). Never out of the Ministry, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,'' said Harry. ``In the - hang on...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
said slowly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day! Your dad said he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) was
probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing, but what if -''
``Sturgis!'' gasped Hermione, looking thunderstruck.
``Sorry?'' said Ron, looking bewildered.
``Sturgis Podmore -'' said Hermione breathlessly, ``arrested for trying to get through a door!
Lucius Malfoy must have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) too! I bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) did it the day you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) there, Harry. Sturgis
had Moodys Invisibility Cloak, right? So, what if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was standing guard by the door, invisible,
and Malfoy heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) move - or guessed someone was there - or just did the Imperius Curse on
the off-chance thered be a guard there? So, when Sturgis next had an opportunity - probably
when it was his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) turn on guard duty again - he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) tried to get into the Department to steal the weapon
for Voldemort - Ron, be quiet - but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) got caught and sent to Azkaban...''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) gazed at Harry.
``And now Rookwoods told Voldemort how to get the weapon?''
``I didnt hear all the conversation, but thats what it sounded like,'' said Harry. ``Rookwood used
to work there... maybe Voldemortll send Rookwood to do it?''
Hermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought. Then, quite abruptly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, ``But you shouldnt have seen this at all, Harry.''
``What?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, taken aback.
``Youre supposed to be learning how to close your m ind to this sort of thing,'' said Hermione,
suddenly stern.
``I know I am,'' said Harry. ``But -''
``Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,'' said Hermione firmly. ``And you
ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on.''
Harry was so angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) for the rest of the day, which proved to be
another bad one. When people were not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors,
they were laughing at Gryffindors abysmal performance in their match against Hufflepuff; the
Slytherins were singing Weasley is our King so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch
had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation.
The week did not improve as it progressed. Harry received two more Ds in Potions; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was still
on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldnt stop himself dwelling on the
dream in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been Voldemort - though he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) didnt bring it up with Ron and Hermione
again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) didnt want another telling-off from Hermione. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wished very much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could
have talked to Sirius about it, but that was out of the question, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tried to push the matter to
the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mind.
Unfortunately, the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mind was no longer the secure place it had once been.
``Get up, Potter.''
A couple of weeks after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) dream of Rookwood, Harry was to be found, yet again, kneeling on
the floor of Snapes office, trying to clear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just been forced, yet again, to relive a
stream of very early memories he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not even realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) still had, most of them concerning
humiliations Dudley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) gang had inflicted upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) in primary school.
``That last memory,'' said Snape. ``What was it?''
``I dont know,'' said Harry, getting wearily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was finding it increasingly difficult to
disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth.
``You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet?''
``No,'' said Snape softly. ``I mean the one with a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened
room...''
``Its... nothing,'' said Harry.
Snapes dark eyes bored into Harrys. Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact
being crucial to Legilimency, Harry blinked and looked away.
``How do that man and that room come to be inside your head, Potter?'' said Snape.
``It -'' said Harry, looking everywhere but at Snape, ``it was -just a dream I had.''
``A dream?'' repeated Snape.
There was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a jar of
purple liquid.
``You do know why we are here, dont you, Potter?'' said Snape, in a low, dangerous voice. ``You
do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job?''
``Yes,'' said Harry stiffly.
``Remind me why we are here, Potter.''
``So I can learn Occlumency,'' said Harry, now glaring at a dead eel.
``Correct, Potter. And dim though you may be -<div class="bookquote">'' Harry looked back at Snape, hating him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) '' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>- I
would have thought that after over two months of lessons you might have made some progress.
How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had?''
``Just that one,'' lied Harry.
``Perhaps,'' said Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) dark, cold eyes narrowin g slightly, ``perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter. Maybe they make you feel special - important?''
``No, they dont,'' said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jaw set and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wand.
``That is just as well, Potter,'' said Snape coldly, ``because you are neither special nor important,
and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) Death Eaters.''
``No - thats your job, isnt it?'' Harry shot at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not meant to say it; it had burst out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in temper. For a long moment they stared at
each other, Harry convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had gone too far. But there was a curious, almost satisfied
expression on Snapes face when he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) answered.
``Yes, Potter,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes glinting. ``That is my job. Now, if you are ready, we will start
again.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand: ``One -- two - three -Legilimens!''
A hundred Dementors were swooping towards Harry across the lake in the grounds... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face in concentration... they were coming closer... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see the dark holes
beneath their hoods... yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could also see Snape standing in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes fixed on
Harrys face, muttering under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breath... and somehow, Snape was growing clearer, and the
Dementors were growing fainter...
Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own wand.
``Protego!''
Snape staggered - his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand flew upwards, away from Harry - and suddenly Harrys mind was
teeming with memories that were not his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>): a hook-nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman,
while a small dark-haired boy cried in a corner... a greasy-haired teenager sat alone in a dark
bedroom, pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>teenager</b></font>) wand at the ceiling, shooting down flies... a girl was laughing as a
scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick -
``ENOUGH!''
Harry felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been pushed hard in the chest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) staggered several steps backwards,
hit some of the shelves covering Snapes walls and heard something crack. Snape was shaking
slightly, and was very white in the face.
The back of Harrys robes was damp. One of the jars behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had broken when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell against
it; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion.
``Reparo,'' hissed Snape, and the jar sealed itself at once. ``Well, Potter... that was certainly an
improvement...'' Panting slightly, Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had again stored
some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was checking they were still
there. ``I dont remember telling you to use a Shield Charm... but there is no doubt that it was
effective...''
Harry did not speak; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt that to say anything might be dangerous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just
broken into Snapes memories, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had just seen scenes from Snapes childhood. It was
unnerving to think that the little boy who had been crying as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) parents shouting was
actually standing in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) with such loathing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes.
``Lets try again, shall we?'' said Snape.
Harry felt a thrill of dread; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was about to pay for what had just happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sure of it.
They moved back into position with the desk between them, Harry feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to find it
much harder to empty his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind this time.
``On the count of three, then,'' said Snape, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand once more. ``One - two -''
Harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind before Snape
cried, ``Legilimens!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was hurtling along the corridor towards the Department of Mysteries, past the blank stone
walls, past the torches - the plain black door was growing ever larger; he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was moving so fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
was going to collide with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was feet from it and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) could see that chink of faint blue
light - The door had flown open! He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was through it at last, inside a black-walled, black-floored
circular room lit with blue-flamed candles, and there were more doors all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) - he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) needed
to go on - but which door ought he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) to take -?
``POTTER!''
Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back again with no memory of having gotten there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was also panting as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor,
really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room.
``Explain yourself!'' said Snape, who was standing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), looking furious.
``I... dunno what happened,'' said Harry truthfully, st anding up. There was a lump on the back of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had hit the ground and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt feverish. ``Ive never seen that before. I
mean, I told you, Ive dreamed about the door... but its never opened before''
``You are not working hard enough!''
For some reason, Snape seemed even angrier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had done two minutes before, when Harry
had seen into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) teachers memories.
``You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that the Dark Lord -''
``Can you tell me something, sir?'' said Harry, firing up again. ``Why do you call Voldemort the
Dark Lord? Ive only ever heard Death Eaters call him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) that.''
Snape opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) mouth in a snarl - and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room.
Snapes head jerked upwards; he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was gazing at the ceiling.
``What the -?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) muttered.
Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought might be the Entrance
Hall. Snape looked round at him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), frowning.
``Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter?''
Harry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. Somewhere above them, the woman screamed again. Snape strode to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
office door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand still held at the ready, and swept out of sight. Harry hesitated for a moment,
then followed.
The screams were indeed coming from the Entrance Hall; they grew louder as Harry ran towards
the stone steps leading up from the dungeons. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the top he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found the Entrance
Hall packed; students had come flooding out of the Great Hall, where dinner was still in
progress, to see what was going on; others had crammed themselves on to the marble staircase.
Harry pushed forwards through a knot of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a
great ring, some of them looking shocked, others even frightened. Professor McGonagall was
directly opposite Harry on the other side of the Hall; she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) looked as though what she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) was
watching made her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) feel faintly sick.
Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the Entrance Hall with her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) wand in one hand
and an empty sherry bottle in the other, looking utterly mad. Her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) hair was sticking up on end, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other; her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) innumerable
shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) shoulders, giving the impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
was falling apart at the seams. Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>), one of them upsidedown; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>). Professor Trelawney was staring, apparently terrified, at something Harry could not see but which seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs.
``No!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) shrieked. ``NO! This cannot be happening... it cannot... I refuse to accept it!''
``You didnt realize this was coming?'' said a high girlish voice, sounding callously amused, and
Harry, moving slightly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right, saw that Trelawneys terrifying vision was nothing other than
Professor Umbridge. ``Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrows weather, you
must surely have realized that your pitiful performance during my inspections, and lack of any
improvement, would make it inevitable that you would be sacked?''
``You c - cant!'' howled Professor Trelawney, tears streaming down her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) face from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
enormous lenses, ``you c - cant sack me! Ive b - been here sixteen years! H - Hogwarts is in -
my h - home!''
``It was your home,'' said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment
stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) toadlike face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) watched Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing uncontrollably, on
to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) trunks, ``until an hour ago, when the Minister of Magic countersigned your Order
of Dismissal. Now kindly remove yourself from this Hall. You are embarrassing us.''
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) stood and watched, with an expression of gloating enjoyment, as Professor Trelawney
shuddered and moaned, rocking backwards and forwards on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) trunk in paroxysms of grief. Harry heard a muffled sob to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left and looked around. Lavender and Parvati were both crying
quietly, their arms round each other. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard footsteps. Professor McGonagall had broken
away from the spectators, marched straight up to Professor Trelawney and was patting her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) firmly
on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) robes.
``There, there, Sibyll... calm down... blow your nose on this... its not as bad as you think,
now... you are not going to have to leave Hogwarts...''
``Oh really, Professor McGonagall?'' said Umbridge in a deadly voice, taking a few steps forward. ``And your authority for that statement is...?''
``That would be mine,'' said a deep voice.
The oaken front doors had swung open. Students beside them scuttled out of the way as
Dumbledore appeared in the entrance. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had been doing out in the grounds Harry could
not imagine, but there was something impressive about the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) framed in the doorway
against an oddly misty night. Leaving the doors wide open behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strode forwards
through the circle of onlookers towards Professor Trelawney, tear-stained and trembling, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>).
``Yours, Professor Dumbledore?'' said Umbridge, with a singularly unpleasant little laugh. ``Im
afraid you do not understand the position. I have here -<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) pulled a parchment scroll from
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) robes '' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister for Magic. Under the
terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the
power to inspect, place upon probation and sack any teacher she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) - that is to say, I - feel is not
performing to the standards required by the Ministry of Magic. I have decided that Professor
Trelawney is not up to scratch. I have dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).''
To Harrys very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) looked down at Professor
Trelawney, who was still sobbing and choking on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) trunk, and said, ``You are quite right, of
course, Professor Umbridge. As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers.
You do not, however, have the authority to send them away from the castle. I am afraid,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) went on, with a courteous little bow, ``that the power to do that still resides with the Headmaster, and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts.''
At this, Professor Trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccough was barely hidden.
``No - no, Ill g - go, Dumbledore! I sh - shall - leave Hogwarts and s - seek my fortune elsewhere -''
``No,'' said Dumbledore sharply. ``It is my wish that you remain, Sibyll.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) turned to Professor McGonagall.
``Might I ask you to escort Sibyll back upstairs, Professor McGonagall?''
``Of course,'' said McGonagall. ``Up you get, Sibyll...''
Professor Sprout came hurrying forwards out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawneys
other arm. Together, they guided her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) past Umbridge and up the marble stairs. Professor Flitwick
went scurrying after them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) wand held out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) squeaked ``Locomotor trunks!'' and
Professor Trelawneys luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>),
Professor Flitwick bringing up the rear.
Professor Umbridge was standing stock still, staring at Dumbledore, who continued to smile
benignly.
``And what,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, in a whisper that carried all around the Entrance Hall, ``are you going to do
with her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) lodgings?''
``Oh, that wont be a problem,'' said Dumbledore pleasantly. ``You see, I have already found us a
new Divination teacher, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) will prefer lodgings on the ground floor.''
``Youve found -?'' said Umbridge shrilly. ``Youve found? Might I remind you, Dumbledore, that under Educational Decree Number Twenty-two -''
``The Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if -and only if- the Headmaster is
unable to find one,'' said Dumbledore. ``And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have
succeeded. May I introduce you?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) turned to face the open front doors, through which night mist was now drifting. Harry heard
hooves. There was a shocked murmur around the Hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved
even further backwards, some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the
newcomer.
Through the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a dark, dangerous night in the
Forbidden Forest: white-blond hair and astonishingly blue eyes; the head and torso of a man
joined to the palomino body of a horse.
``This is Firenze,'' said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck Umbridge. ``I think youll find him (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>) suitable.''
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
The Centaur and the Sneak
``Ill bet you wish you hadnt given up Divination now, dont you, Hermione?'' asked Parvati,
smirking.
It was breakfast time, two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) eyelashes around her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) wand and examining the effect in the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) spoon. They were to
have their first lesson with Firenze that morning.
``Not really'' said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. ``Ive never really
liked horses.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) turned a page of the newspaper and scanned its columns.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>)s not a horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>)s a centaur!'' said Lavender, sounding shocked.
``A gorgeous centaur...'' sighed Parvati.
``Either way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>)s still got four legs,'' said Hermione coolly. ``Anyway I thought you two were all
upset that Trelawney had gone?''
``We are!'' Lavender assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). ``We went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) office to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>); we took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) some daffodils - not the honking ones that Sprouts got, nice ones.''
``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)?'' asked Harry.
``Not very good, poor thing,'' said Lavender sympathetically. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was crying and saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)d
rather leave the castle forever than stay here where Umbridge is, and I dont blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>),
Umbridge was horrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), wasnt she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)?''
``Ive got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible,'' said Hermione darkly.
``Impossible,'' said Ron, who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) cant get any worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s been already.''
``You mark my words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher
without consulting her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>),'' said Hermione, closing the newspaper. ``Especially another part-human.
You saw the look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) face when she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) saw Firenze.''
After breakfast Hermione departed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) Arithmancy class as Harry and Ron followed Parvati
and Lavender into the Entrance Hall, heading for Divination.
``Arent we going up to North Tower?'' asked Ron, looking puzzled, as Parvati bypassed the
marble staircase.
Parvati looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) scornfully over her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) shoulder.
``How dyou expect Firenze to climb that ladder? Were in classroom eleven now, it was on the
noticeboard yesterday.''
Classroom eleven was on the ground floor along the corridor leading off the Entrance Hall from
the opposite side to the Great Hall. Harry knew it was one of those classrooms that were never
used regularly, and therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) entered it right behind Ron, and found himself in the middle of a forest clearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was
therefore momentarily stunned.
``What the -?''
The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it; their leafy
branches fanned across the ceiling and windows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of
soft, dappled, green light. The students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor
with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders, arms wrapped around their knees or
folded tightly across their chests, and all looking rather nervous. In the middle of the clearing,
where there were no trees, stood Firenze.
``Harry Potter,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said, holding out a hand when Harry entered.
``Er - hi,'' said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) unblinkingly through
those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile. ``Er - good to see you.''
``And you,'' said the centaur, inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) white-blond head. ``It was foretold that we would meet
again.''
Harry noticed there was the shadow of a hoof-shaped bruise on Firenzes chest. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to
join the rest of the class on the ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw they were all looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in awe, apparently
deeply impressed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom they seemed to find
intimidating.
When the door was closed and the last student had sat down on a tree stump beside the
wastepaper basket, Firenze gestured around the room.
``Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,'' said Firenze, when everyone
had settled down, ``in imitation of my natural habitat. I would have preferred to teach you in the
Forbidden Forest, which was - until Monday - my home... but that is no longer possible.''
``Please - er - sir -<div class="bookquote">'' said Parvati breathlessly, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) hand, '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>- why not? Weve been in there
with Hagrid, were not frightened!''
``It is not a question of your bravery,'' said Firenze, ``but of my position. I cannot return to the
Forest. My herd has banished me.''
``Herd?'' said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) was thinking of cows. ``What -
oh!'' Comprehension dawned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) face. ``There are more o f you!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) said, stunned.
``Did Hagrid breed you, like the Thestrals?'' asked Dean eagerly.
Firenze turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) head very slowly to face Dean, who seemed to realize at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) had said
something very offensive.
``I didnt - I meant - sorry'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) finished in a hushed voice.
``Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans,'' said Firenze quietly. There was a pause,
then Parvati raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) hand again.
``Please, sir... why have the other centaurs banished you?''
``Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore,'' said Firenze. ``They see this as a
betrayal of our kind.''
Harry remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for
allowing Harry to ride to safety on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a common mule. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wondered
whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest.
``Let us begin,'' said Firenze. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swished his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) long palomino tail, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand towards the leafy canopy overhead, then lowered it slowly, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did so, the light in the room dimmed, so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight, and stars appeared on the ceiling.
There were oohs and gasps and Ron said audibly, ``Blimey!''
``Lie back on the floor,'' said Firenze in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) calm voice, ``and observe the heavens. Here is written, for those who can see, the fortune of our races.''
Harry stretched out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back and gazed upwards at the ceiling. A twinkling red star winked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from overhead.
``I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in Astronomy,'' said
Firenzes calm voice, ``and that you have mapped the stars progress through the heavens.
Centaurs have unraveled the mysteries of these movements over centuries. Our findings teach us
that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us -''
``Professor Trelawney did astrology with us!'' said Parvati excitedly, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) hand in front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) so that it stuck up in the air as she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) back. ``Mars causes accidents and burns and
things like that, and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now -<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) drew a right-angle in the
air above her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) '' (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>- that means people need to be extra careful when handling hot things -''
``That,'' said Firenze calmly, ``is human nonsense.''
Parvatis hand fell limply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) side.
``Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents,'' said Firenze, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hooves thudded over the mossy floor.
``These are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe, and are
unaffected by planetary movements.''
``Professor Trelawney -<div class="bookquote">'' began Parvati, in a hurt and indignant voice.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Trelawney/Sibyll/Sibyll Trelawney</b></font>)</div>- is a human,'' said Firenze simply. ``And is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of
your kind.''
Harry turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head very slightly to look at Parvati. She (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) looked very offended, as did several of
the people surrounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>).
``Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,'' continued Firenze, and Harry heard the
swishing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tail again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked up and down before them, ``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Trelawney</b></font>) wastes her (<font color='blue'><b>Trelawney</b></font>) time, in the
main, on the self-flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling. I, however, am here to explain
the wisdom of centaurs, which is impersonal and impartial. We watch the skies for the great tides
of evil or change that are sometimes marked there. It may take ten years to be sure of what we
are seeing.''
Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry.
``In the past decade, the indications have been that wizardkind is living through nothing more
than a brief calm between two wars. Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting
that the fight must soon break out again. How soon, centaurs may attempt to divine by the
burning of certain herbs and leaves, by the observation of fume and flame...''
It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended. They did indeed burn sage and
mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and
symbols in the pungent fumes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could
see any of the signs he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) described, telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this, that it
took centaurs years and years to become competent, and finished by telling them that it was
foolish to put too much faith in such things, anyway, because even centaurs sometimes read them
wrongly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was nothing like any human teacher Harry had ever had. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) priority did not seem
to be to teach them what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing, not even
centaurs knowledge, was foolproof.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)s not very definite on anything, is he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)?'' said Ron in a low voice, as they put out their
mallowsweet fire. ``I mean, I could do with a few more details about this war were about to
have, couldnt you?''
The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped; Harry had completely
forgotten they were still inside the castle, and quite convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was really in the Forest.
The class filed out, looking slightly perplexed.
Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called, ``Harry Potter, a word,
please.''
Harry turned. The centaur advanced a little towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Ron hesitated.
``You may stay,'' Firenze told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). ``But close the door, please.'' Ron hastened to obey.
``Harry Potter, you are a friend of Hagrids, are you not?'' said the centaur.
``Yes,'' said Harry.
``Then give him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) a warning from me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) attempt is not working. He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) would do better to abandon
it.''
``His (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) attempt is not working?'' Harry repeated blankly.
``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) would do better to abandon it,'' said Firenze, nodding. ``I would warn Hagrid myself, but
I am banished - it would be unwise for me to go too near the Forest now - Hagrid has troubles
enough, without a centaurs battle.''
``But - whats Hagrid attempting to do?'' said Harry nervously.
Firenze surveyed Harry impassively.
``Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service,'' said Firenze, ``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) has long since earned my respect for the care he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) shows all living creatures. I shall not betray his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) secret. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) must be
brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) senses. The attempt is not working. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>), Harry Potter. Good-day to you.''
The happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler interview had long since
evaporated. As a dull March blurred into a squally April, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life seemed to have become one
long series of worries and problems again.
Umbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures lessons, so it had been very
difficult to deliver Firenzes warning to Hagrid. At last, Harry had managed it by pretending he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d
lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and doubling back after class one day.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d repeated Firenzes words, Hagrid gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for a moment through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) puffy,
blackened eyes, apparently taken aback. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed to pull himself together.
``Nice bloke, Firenze,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said gruffly, ``but he (<font color='blue'><b>bloke</b></font>) don know what he (<font color='blue'><b>bloke</b></font>)s talkin abou on this. The
attemps comin on fine.''
``Hagrid, whatre you up to?'' asked Harry seriously. ``Because youve got to be careful, Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and, if you ask me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s on a roll. If youre doing anything you shouldnt be, youll be -''
``Theres things more importan than keepin a job,'' said Hagrid, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands shook slightly
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said this and a basin full of Knarl droppings crashed to the floor. ``Don worry abou me,
Harry jus get along now, theres a good lad.''
Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) floor, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt
thoroughly dispirited as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trudged back up to the castle.
Meanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding them, the OWLs were drawing
ever nearer. All the fifth-years were suffering from stress to some degree, but Hannah Abbott
became the first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) burst into tears
during Herbology and sobbed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school
now.
If it had not been for the D.A. lessons, Harry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have been extremely unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sometimes felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was living for the hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time, swelling with pride as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fellow D.A. members and saw how far they had come. Indeed, Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was going to react when all the members of the D.A. received Outstanding in their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWLs.
They had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had been very keen to practice,
though, as Harry kept reminding them, producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit
classroom when they were not under threat was very different from producing it when
confronted by something like a Dementor.
``Oh, dont be such a killjoy,'' said Cho brightly, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) silvery swan-shaped Patronus soar
around the Room of Requirement during their last lesson before Easter. ``Theyre so pretty!''
``Theyre not supposed to be pretty, theyre supposed to protect you,'' said Harry patiently. ``What we really need is a Boggart or something; thats how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the Boggart was pretending to be a Dementor -''
``But that would be really scary!'' said Lavender, who was shooting puffs of silver vapour out of
the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand. ``And I still -cant - do it!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) added angrily.
Neville was having trouble, too. His (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) face was screwed up in concentration, but only feeble wisps
of silver smoke issued from his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) wand tip.
``Youve got to think of something happy,'' Harry reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Im trying,'' said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) round face was actually shining
with sweat.
``Harry, I think Im doing it'' yelled Seamus, who had been brought along to his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) first ever D.A.
meeting by Dean. ``Look - ah -its gone... but it was definitely something hairy, Harry!''
Hermiones Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gamboling around her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
``They are sort of nice, arent they?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, looking at it fondly.
The door of the Room of Requirement opened, and closed. Harry looked round to see who had
entered, but there did not seem to be anybody there. It was a few moments before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized that
the people close to the door had fallen silent. Next thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew, something was tugging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
robes somewhere near the knee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked down and saw, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very great astonishment, Dobby
the house-elf peering up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) usual eight woolly hats.
``Hi, Dobby!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``What are you - Whats wrong?''
The elfs eyes were wide with terror and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was shaking. The members of the D.A. closest to
Harry had fallen silent; everybody in the room was watching Dobby. The few Patronuses people
had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room looking much darker than
before.
``Harry Potter, sir...'' squeaked the elf, trembling from head to foot, ``Harry Potter, sir... Dobby
has come to warn you... but the house-elves have been warned not to tell...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran head-first at the wall. Harry, who had some experience of Dobbys habits of self punishment, made to seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but Dobby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eight hats. Hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy.
``Whats happened, Dobby?'' Harry asked, grabbing the elfs tiny arm and holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) away from anything with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might seek to hurt himself.
``Harry Potter... she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)... she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)...''
Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) free fist. Harry seized that, too.
``Whos she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), Dobby?''
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew; surely only one she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could induce such fear in Dobby? The elf looked
up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly.
``Umbridge?'' asked Harry, horrified.
Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head on Harrys knees. Harry held him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at arms length.
``What about her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)? Dobby - she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hasnt found out about this - about us - about the D.A.?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) read the answer in the elfs stricken face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick
himself and fell to the floor.
``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) coming?'' Harry asked quietly.
Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bare feet hard on the floor.
``Yes, Harry Potter, yes!''
Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the
thrashing elf.
``WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?'' Harry bellowed. ``RUN!''
They all pelted towards the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through.
Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and
make it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine; if they just took refuge in the
library or the Owlery, which were both nearer -
``Harry, come on!'' shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get
out.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms to join the back of the queue.
``Dobby - this is an order - get back down to the kitchen with the other elves and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) asks you
whether you warned me, lie and say no!'' said Harry. ``And I forbid you to hurt yourself!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
added, dropping the elf as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) made it over the threshold at last and slammed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Thank you, Harry Potter!'' squeaked Dobby, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) streaked off. Harry glanced left and right,
the others were all moving so fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the
corridor before they vanished; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) started to run right; there was a boys bathroom up ahead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could pretend he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d been in there all the time if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could just reach it -
``AAARGH!''
Something caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) around the ankles and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell spectacularly, skidding along on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) front
for six feet before coming to a halt. Someone behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was laughing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rolled over on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
back and saw Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase.
``Trip Jinx, Potter!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) said. ``Hey Professor - PROFESSOR! Ive got one!''
Umbridge came bustling round the far corner, breathless but wearing a delighted smile.
``Its him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. ``Excellent, Draco, excellent, oh,
very good - fifty points to Slytherin! Ill take him (<font color='blue'><b>Draco</b></font>) from here... stand up, Potter!''
Harry got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, glaring at the pair of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never seen Umbridge looking so happy.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm in a vice-like grip and turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy.
``You hop along and see if you can round up any more of them, Draco,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said. ``Tell the others
to look in the library - anybody out of breath - check the bathrooms, Miss Parkinson can do the
girls ones - off you go - and you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) added in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) softest, most dangerous voice, as Malfoy
walked away, ``you can come with me to the Headmasters office, Potter.''
They were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. Harry wondered how many of the others had
been caught. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought of Ron - Mrs. Weasley would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) - and of how Hermione would
feel if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was expelled before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) OWLs. And it had been Seamuss very first
meeting... and Neville had been getting so good...
``Fizzing Whizzbee,'' sang Umbridge; the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split
open, and they ascended the moving stone staircase. They reached the polished door with the
griffin knocker, but Umbridge did not bother to knock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) strode straight inside, still holding
tight to Harry.
The office was full of people. Dumbledore was sitting behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) desk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) expression serene, the
tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) long fingers together. Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) face
extremely tense. Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, was rocking backwards and forwards on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with the situation; Kingsley Shacklebolt
and a tough-looking wizard with very short wiry hair whom Harry did not recognize, were
positioned on either side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of Percy
Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hands,
apparently poised to take notes.
The portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses were not shamming sleep tonight. All of
them were alert and serious, watching what was happening below them. As Harry entered, a few
flitted into neighboring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbors ear.
Harry pulled himself free of Umbridges grasp as the door swung shut behind them. Cornelius
Fudge was glaring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) face.
``Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) said. ``Well, well, well...''
Harry replied with the dirtiest look he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could muster. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart drummed madly inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain was oddly cool and clear.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,'' said Umbridge. There was an indecent excitement
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice, the same callous pleasure Harry had heard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) watched Professor Trelawney
dissolving with misery in the Entrance Hall. ``The Malfoy boy cornered him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>).''
``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), did he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)?'' said Fudge appreciatively. ``I must remember to tell Lucius. Well, Potter... I
expect you know why you are here?''
Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant yes: his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth had opened and the word was
half-formed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) caught sight of Dumbledores face. Dumbledore was not looking directly at
Harry - his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes were fixed on a point just over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder - but as Harry stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head a fraction of an inch to each side.
Harry changed direction mid-word.
``Ye--no.''
``I beg your pardon?'' said Fudge.
``No,'' said Harry, firmly.
``You dont know why you are here?''
``No, I dont,'' said Harry.
Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge. Harry took advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
momentary inattention to steal another quick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest
of nods and the shadow of a wink.
``So you have no idea,'' said Fudge, in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm, ``why Professor
Umbridge has brought you to this office? You are not aware that you have broken any school
rules?''
``School rules?'' said Harry. ``No.''
``Or Ministry Decrees?'' amended Fudge angrily.
``Not that Im aware of,'' said Harry blandly.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart was still hammering very fast. It was almost worth telling these lies to watch Fudges
blood pressure rising, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not see how on earth he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would get away with them; if
somebody had tipped off Umbridge about the D.A. then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), the leader, might as well be packing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk right now.
``So, its news to you, is it,'' said Fudge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice now thick with anger, ``that an illegal student
organization has been discovered within this school?''
``Yes, it is,'' said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.
``I think, Minister,'' said Umbridge silkily from beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), ``we might make better progress if I
fetch our informant.''
``Yes, yes, do,'' said Fudge, nodding, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room. ``Theres nothing like a good witness, is t here, Dumbledore?''
``Nothing at all, Cornelius,'' said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) head.
There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then Harry heard the
door open behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Umbridge moved past him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) into the room, gripping by the shoulder Chos
curly-haired friend, Marietta, who was hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) hands.
``Dont be scared, dear, dont be frightened,'' said Professor Umbridge softly, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) on the
back, ``its quite all right, now. You have done the right thing. The Minister is very pleased with
you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>)ll be telling your mother what a good girl youve been.
<div class="bookquote">``Mariettas mother, Minister,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) added, looking up at Fudge, <div class="bookquote">``is Madam Edgecombe from the
Department of Magical Transportation, Floo Network office - she (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>)s been helping us police the
Hogwarts fires, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jolly good, jolly good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge heartily. <div class="bookquote">``Like mother, like daughter, eh? Well, come on,
now, dear, look up, dont be shy, lets hear what youve got to - galloping gargoyles!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marietta/Marietta Edgecombe</b></font>)</div>As Marietta raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) head, Fudge leapt backwards in shock, nearly landing himself in the fire.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) cursed, and stamped on the hem of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) cloak which had started to smoke. Marietta gave a
wail and pulled the neck of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) robes right up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) eyes, but not before everyone had seen that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) face was horribly disfigured by a series of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>)
nose and cheeks to form the word SNEAK.
<div class="bookquote">``Never mind the spots now, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``just take your robes away from
your mouth and tell the Minister -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>But Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) head frantically.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well, you silly girl, Ill tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>snapped Umbridge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hitched her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) sickly smile back on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) face and said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Minister, Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had something she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted to tell me. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said that if I
proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, sometimes known as the Room of Requirement,
I would find out something to my advantage. I questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a little further and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) admitted
that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortunately, at that point this hex,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) waved
impatiently at Mariettas concealed face, <div class="bookquote">``came into operation and upon catching sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marietta/Marietta Edgecombe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) evidently imagined was a kind and
fatherly look, <div class="bookquote">``it is very brave of you, my dear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge. You did
exactly the right thing. Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What was its
purpose? Who was there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But Marietta would not speak; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) merely shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) head again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) eyes wide and fearful.
<div class="bookquote">``Havent we got a counter-jinx for this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>Fudge asked Umbridge impatiently, gesturing at
Mariettas face. <div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) can speak freely?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have not yet managed to find one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>Umbridge admitted grudgingly, and Harry felt a surge of
pride in Hermiones jinxing ability. <div class="bookquote">``But it doesnt matter if she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wont speak, I can take up the
story from here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a
number of fellow students in the Hogs Head in Hogsmeade -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what is your evidence for that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>cut in Professor McGonagall.
<div class="bookquote">``I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Widdershins</b></font>) was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Widdershins</b></font>) hearing was quite unimpaired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge
smugly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Widdershins</b></font>) heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, so thats why he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) wasnt prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said
Professor McGonagall, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``What an interesting insight into our justice
system!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Blatant corruption!''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind
Dumbledores desk. <div class="bookquote">``The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they
did not!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore softly.
<div class="bookquote">``The purpose of Potters meeting with these students,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>continued Professor Umbridge, <div class="bookquote">``was to
persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry
has decided are inappropriate for school-age -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think youll find youre wrong there, Dolores,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore quietly, peering at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) over
the half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) crooked nose.
Harry stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) out of this one; if
Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Widdershins</b></font>) had said in the Hogs Head there was simply
no escaping it.
<div class="bookquote">``Oho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his (<font color='blue'><b>Widdershins</b></font>) feet again. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, do lets hear the
latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on
- Willy Widdershins was lying, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Widdershins</b></font>)? Or was it Potters identical twin in the Hogs Head that
day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming
back to life and a couple of invisible Dementors?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, very good, Minister, very good!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry could have kicked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling
gently, too.
<div class="bookquote">``Cornelius, I do not deny - and nor, I am sure, does Harry - that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in the Hogs Head that
day, nor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group. I am
merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time,
illegal. If you remember, the Ministry Decree banning all student societies was not put into effect
until two days after Harrys Hogsmeade meeting, so he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was not breaking any rules at all in the
Hogs Head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>Percy looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) had been struck in the face by something very heavy. Fudge remained
motionless in mid-bounce, his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) mouth hanging open.
Umbridge recovered first.
<div class="bookquote">``Thats all very fine, Headmaster,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, smiling sweetly, <div class="bookquote">``but we are now nearly six months
on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was
not illegal, all those that have happened since most certainly are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, surveying her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) with polite interest over the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) interlocked
fingers, <div class="bookquote">``they certainly would be, if they had continued after the Decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence that any such meetings continued?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and rather thought Kingsley whispered
something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) could have sworn, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) felt something brush against his (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) side, a gentle
something like a draught or bird wings, but looking down he (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) saw nothing there.
<div class="bookquote">``Evidence?''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>repeated Umbridge, with that horrible wide toad-like smile. <div class="bookquote">``Have you not been
listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, can she (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>) tell us about six months worth of meetings?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``I was under the impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>) was merely reporting a meeting tonight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss Edgecombe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge at once, <div class="bookquote">``tell us how long these meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your head, Im sure that wont make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach. This was it, they had hit a dead end of solid
evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside.
<div class="bookquote">``Just nod or shake your head, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta, <div class="bookquote">``come on, now, that
wont re-activate the jinx.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marietta/Marietta Edgecombe</b></font>)</div>Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Mariettas face. Only her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) eyes were visible
between the pulled-up robes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) curly fringe. Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>)
eyes looked oddly blank. And then - to Harrys utter amazement - Marietta shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) head.
Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge, then back at Marietta.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont think you understood the question, did you, dear? Im asking whether youve been going to these meetings for the past six months? You have, havent you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marietta/Marietta Edgecombe</b></font>)</div>Again, Marietta shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge in a testy voice.
<div class="bookquote">``I would have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) meaning was quite clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall harshly, <div class="bookquote">``there
have been no secret meetings for the past six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>McGonagall/Minerva/Minerva McGonagall</b></font>)</div>Marietta nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``But there was a meeting tonight!''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge furiously. <div class="bookquote">``There was a meeting, Miss
Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) not, Potter organized it, Potter - why are you shaking your head, girl?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, usually when a person shakes their head,''  (<font color='red'><b>McGonagall/Minerva/Minerva McGonagall</b></font>)</div>said McGonagall coldly, <div class="bookquote">``they mean no. So
unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign-language as yet unknown to humans -''
 (<font color='red'><b>McGonagall/Minerva/Minerva McGonagall</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) round to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) and began shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) very
hard. A split second later Dumbledore was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) feet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand raised; Kingsley started
forwards and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hands in the air as though they had
been burned.
<div class="bookquote">``I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore and, for the first time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) looked angry.
<div class="bookquote">``You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kingsley/Kingsley Shacklebolt/Shacklebolt</b></font>)</div>said Kingsley, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) deep, slow voice. <div class="bookquote">``You
dont want to get yourself into trouble, now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, yes -
youre right, Shacklebolt - I - I forgot myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marietta/Marietta Edgecombe</b></font>)</div>Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) seemed neither perturbed
by Umbridges sudden attack, nor relieved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) release; she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was still clutching her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) robe up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) oddly blank eyes and staring straight ahead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
A sudden suspicion, connected to Kingsleys whisper and the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) had felt shoot past him (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>),
sprang into Harrys mind.
<div class="bookquote">``Dolores,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something once and for all, <div class="bookquote">``the meeting
tonight - the one we know definitely happened -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, pulling herself together, <div class="bookquote">``yes... well, Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor, accompanied by certain trustworthy students, so as to
catch those in the meeting red-handed. It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival,
however, because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction. It
does not matter, however. I have all their names here, Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of
Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind. We needed evidence and the room
provided.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>And to Harrys horror, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) withdrew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon
the Room of Requirements wall and handed it to Fudge.
<div class="bookquote">``The moment I saw Potters name on the list, I knew what we were dealing with,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said softly.
<div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge spreading</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, a smile spreading across his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, <div class="bookquote">``excellent, Dolores. And... by
thunder...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge spreading</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up at Dumbledore, who was still standing beside Marietta, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand held loosely in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``See what theyve named themselves?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledores Army.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) gazed at the heading
scribbled by Hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) looked
up, smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, the game is up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said simply. <div class="bookquote">``Would you like a written confession from me, Cornelius
- or will a statement before these witnesses suffice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other. There was fear in both faces. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not
understand what was going on, and nor, apparently, did Fudge.
<div class="bookquote">``Statement?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge slowly. <div class="bookquote">``What - I dont -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dumbledores Army, Cornelius,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, still smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) waved the list of names
before Fudges face. <div class="bookquote">``Not Potters Army. Dumbledores Army.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But - but -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Understanding blazed suddenly in Fudges face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) took a horrified step backwards, yelped, and
jumped out of the fire again.
<div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) whispered, stamping again on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) smouldering cloak.
<div class="bookquote">``Thats right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore pleasantly.
<div class="bookquote">``You organized this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore.
<div class="bookquote">``You recruited these students for - for your army?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, nodding. <div class="bookquote">``Merely to see
whether they would be interested in joining me. I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss
Edgecombe, of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marietta/Marietta Edgecombe</b></font>)</div>Marietta nodded. Fudge looked from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) to Dumbledore, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) chest swelling.
<div class="bookquote">``Then you have been plotting against me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) yelled.
<div class="bookquote">``Thats right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore cheerfully.
<div class="bookquote">``NO!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>shouted Harry.
Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), McGonagall widened her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) eyes threateningly, but it
had suddenly dawned on Harry what Dumbledore was about to do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) could not let it
happen.
<div class="bookquote">``No -- Professor Dumbledore -!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore calmly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, shut up, Potter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>barked Fudge, who was still ogling Dumbledore with a kind of horrified
delight. <div class="bookquote">``Well, well, well - I came here tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Instead you get to arrest me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Its like losing a Knut and finding a
Galleon, isnt it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Weasley!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>cried Fudge, now positively quivering with delight, <div class="bookquote">``Weasley, have you written it all
down, everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)s said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) confession, have you got it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, I think so, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy eagerly, whose nose was splattered with ink from the speed
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) note-taking.
<div class="bookquote">``The bit about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)s been trying to build up an army against the Ministry, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)s been
working to destabilize me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, Ive got it, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy, scanning his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) notes joyfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, now radiant with glee, <div class="bookquote">``duplicate your notes, Weasley, and send a
copy to the Daily Prophet at once. If we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>Percy dashed from the room, slamming the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>), and Fudge turned back to
Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``You will now be escorted back to the Ministry, where you will be formally
charged, then sent to Azkaban to await trial!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore gently, <div class="bookquote">``yes. Yes, I thought we might hit that little snag.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Snag?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) voice still vibrating with joy. <div class="bookquote">``I see no snag, Dumbledore!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``Im afraid I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, really?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well - its just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to - what is the
phrase? - come quietly. I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all, Cornelius. I have
absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban. I could break out, of course - but what a waste
of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>Umbridges face was growing steadily redder; she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was being filled with
boiling water. Fudge stared at Dumbledore with a very silly expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) face, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) made a
small choking noise, then looked round at Kingsley and the man with short grey hair, who alone
of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far. The latter gave Fudge a reassuring
nod and moved forwards a little, away from the wall. Harry saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand drift, almost casually,
towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont be silly, Dawlish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore kindly. <div class="bookquote">``Im sure you are an excellent Auror - I seem to remember that you achieved Outstanding in all your NEWT s -- but if you attempt to -- er -- bring me in by force, I will have to hurt you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man called Dawlish blinked rather foolishly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) looked towards Fudge again, but this time
seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next.
<div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>sneered Fudge, recovering himself, <div class="bookquote">``you intend to take on Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores
and myself single-handed, do you, Dumbledore?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Merlins beard, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``not unless you are foolish enough to force me
to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) will not be single-handed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall loudly, plunging her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) hand inside her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
robes.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh yes he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) will, Minerva!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore sharply. <div class="bookquote">``Hogwarts needs you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Enough of this rubbish!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) own wand. <div class="bookquote">``Dawlish! Shacklebolt! Take
him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A streak of silver light flashed around the room; there was a bang like a gunshot and the floor
trembled; a hand grabbed the scruff of Harrys neck and forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) down on the floor as a
second silver flash went off; several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes screeched and a cloud of dust
filled the air. Coughing in the dust, Harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in
front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); there was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried, <div class="bookquote">``No!'' (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>; then there was the sound
of breaking glass, frantically scuffling footsteps, a groan... and silence.
Harry struggled around to see who was half-strangling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and saw Professor McGonagall
crouched beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) had forced both him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) and Marietta out of harms way. Dust was still
floating gently down through the air on to them. Panting slightly, Harry saw a very tall figure
moving towards them.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, getting up and dragging Harry and Marietta with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>).
The dust was clearing. The wreckage of the office loomed into view: Dumbledores desk had
been overturned, all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor, their silver instruments
in pieces. Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor. Fawkes the
phoenix soared in wide circles above them, singing softly.
<div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked very suspicious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said
Dumbledore in a low voice. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) was remarkably quick on the uptake, modifying Miss
Edgecombes memory like that while everyone was looking the other way - thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>), for me,
wont you, Minerva?
``Now, they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to
communicate - you must act as though no time has passed, as though they were merely knocked
to the ground, they will not remember -''
``Where will you go, Dumbledore?'' whispered Professor McGonagall. ``Grimmauld Place?''
``Oh no,'' said Dumbledore, with a grim smile, ``I am not leaving to go into hiding. Fudge will
soon wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)d never dislodged me from Hogwarts, I promise you.''
``Professor Dumbledore...'' Harry began.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not know what to say first: how sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had started the D.A. in the first place
and caused all this trouble, or how terrible he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) from
expulsion? But Dumbledore cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) off before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) could say another word.
``Listen to me, Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said urgently. ``You must study Occlumency as hard as you can, do you understand me? Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams - you will understand why soon enough, but you must promise me -''
The man called Dawlish was stirring. Dumbledore seized Harrys wrist.
``Remember - close your mind -<div class="bookquote">''
But as Dumbledores fingers closed over Harrys skin, a pain shot through the scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
forehead and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) felt again that terrible, snakelike longing to strike Dumbledore, to bite him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), to
hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) -
'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>- you will understand,'' whispered Dumbledore.
Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>). Dumbledore released Harry, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
hand and grasped the phoenixs long golden tail. There was a flash of fire and the pair of them
were gone.
``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)?'' yelled Fudge, pushing himself up from the floor. ``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)?''
``I dont know!'' shouted Kingsley, also leaping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) feet.
``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) cant have Disapparated!'' cried Umbridge. ``You cant do it from inside this school -''
``The stairs!'' cried Dawlish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) flung himself upon the door, wrenched it open and
disappeared, followed closely by Kingsley and Umbridge. Fudge hesitated, then got slowly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>)
feet, brushing dust from his (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) front. There was a long and painful silence.
``Well, Minerva,'' said Fudge nastily, straightening his (<font color='blue'><b>Kingsley</b></font>) torn shirtsleeve, ``Im afraid this is the end
of your friend Dumbledore.''
``You think so, do you?'' said Professor McGonagall scornfully.
Fudge seemed not to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was looking around at the wrecked office. A few of the
portraits hissed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>); one or two even made rude hand gestures.
``Youd better get those two off to bed,'' said Fudge, looking back at Professor McGonagall with a dismissive nod towards Harry and Marietta.
Professor McGonagall said nothing, but marched Harry and Marietta to the door. As it swung
closed behind them, Harry heard Phineas Nigelluss voice.
``You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts... but you cannot deny he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s
got style...''
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
Snapes Worst Memory
BY ORDER OF THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Dolores Jane Umbridge -LRB-High Inquisitor-RRB- has replaced Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-eight.
Signed: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister for Magic
The notices had gone up all around the school overnight, but they did not explain how every
single person within the castle seemed to know that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors, the
High Inquisitor, the Minister for Magic and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) Junior Assistant to escape. No matter where
Harry went within the castle, the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledores flight, and though
some of the details may have gone awry in the retelling -LRB-Harry overheard one second-year girl
assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St. Mungos with a pumpkin for a head-RRB- it was
surprising how accurate the rest of their information was. Everybody knew, for instance, that
Harry and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in Dumbledores office
and, as Marietta was now in the hospital wing, Harry found himself besieged with requests to
give a first-hand account.
``Dumbledore will be back before long,'' said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from
Herbology, after listening intently to Harrys story. ``They couldnt keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) away in our second
year and they wont be able to this time. The Fat Friar told me -<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice
conspiratorially, so that Harry, Ron and Hermione had to lean closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to hear '' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>- that
Umbridge tried to get back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) office last night after theyd searched the castle and grounds
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Couldnt get past the gargoyle. The Heads office has sealed itself against her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).'' Ernie
smirked. ``Apparently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had a right little tantrum.''
``Oh, I expect she (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) really fancied herself sitting up there in the Heads office,'' said Hermione
viciously, as they walked up the stone steps into the Entrance Hall. ``Lording it over all the other
teachers, the stupid puffed-up, power-crazy old -''
``Now, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger?''
Draco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door, closely followed by Crabbe and Goyle. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>)
pale, pointed face was alight with malice.
``Afraid Im going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) drawled.
``Its only teachers who can dock points from houses, Malfoy,'' said Ernie at once.
``Yeah, were prefects, too, remember?'' snarled Ron.
``I know prefects cant dock points, Weasel King,'' sneered Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
``But members of the Inquisitorial Squad -''
``The what!'' said Hermione sharply.
``The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,'' said Malfoy, pointing towards a tiny silver I on his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) robes just beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) prefects badge. ``A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-picked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial Squad do
have the power to dock points... so, Granger, Ill have five from you for being rude about our
new Headmistress. Macmillan, five for contradicting me. Five because I dont like you, Potter.
Weasley, your shirts untucked, so Ill have another five for that. Oh yeah, I forgot, youre a
Mudblood, Granger, so ten off for that.''
Ron pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wand, but Hermione pushed it away, whispering, ``Dont!''
``Wise move, Granger,'' breathed Malfoy. ``New Head, new times... be good now, Potty... Weasel King...''
Laughing heartily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) strode away with Crabbe and Goyle.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was bluffing,'' said Ernie, looking appalled. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) cant be allowed to dock points... that
would be ridiculous... it would completely undermine the prefect system.''
But Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned automatically towards the giant hour-glasses set in
niches along the wall behind them, which recorded the house-points. Gryffindor and Ravenclaw
had been neck and neck in the lead that morning. Even as they watched, stones flew upwards,
reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs. In fact, the only glass that seemed unchanged was the
emerald-filled one of Slytherin.
``Noticed, have you?'' said Freds voice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined Harry, Ron, Hermione and
Ernie in front of the hour-glasses.
``Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,'' said Harry furiously, as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the Gryffindor hour-glass.
``Yeah, Montague tried to do us during break,'' said George.
``What do you mean, tried?'' said Ron quickly.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) never managed to get all the words out,'' said Fred, ``due to the fact that we forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor.''
Hermione looked very shocked.
``But youll get into terrible trouble!''
``Not until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I dunno where we sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>),'' said
Fred coolly. ``Anyway... weve decided we dont care about getting into trouble any more.''
``Have you ever?'' asked Hermione.
``Course we have,'' said George. ``Never been expelled, have we?''
``Weve always known where to draw the line,'' said Fred.
``We might have put a toe across it occasionally,'' said George.
``But weve always stopped short of causing real mayhem,'' said Fred.
``But now?'' said Ron tentatively.
``Well, now -<div class="bookquote">'' said George.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>- what with Dumbledore gone -<div class="bookquote">'' said Fred.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>- we reckon a bit of mayhem --<div class="bookquote">'' said George.
'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-- is exactly what our dear new Head deserves,'' said Fred.
``You mustnt!'' whispered Hermione. ``You really mustnt! She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)d love a reason to expel you!''
``You dont get it, Hermione, do you?'' said Fred, smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). ``We dont care about staying anymore. Wed walk out right now if we werent determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first. So, anyway,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) watch, ``phase one is about to begin. Id get in the Great Hall for lunch, if I were you, that way the teachers will see you cant have had anything to do with it.''
``Anything to do with what?'' said Hermione anxiously.
``Youll see,'' said George. ``Run along, now.''
Fred and George turned away and disappeared into the swelling crowd descending the stairs
towards lunch. Looking highly disconcerted, Ernie muttered something about unfinished
Transfiguration homework and scurried away.
``I think we should get out of here, you know,'' said Hermione nervously. ``Just in case''
``Yeah, all right,'' said Ron, and the three of them moved towards the doors to the Great Hall, but
Harry had barely glimpsed the days ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on the shoulder and, turning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found himself almost nose-to-nose with Filch the caretaker.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took several hasty steps backwards; Filch was best viewed at a distance.
``The Headmistress would like to see you, Potter,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leered.
``I didnt do it,'' said Harry stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred and George were planning. Filchs jowls wobbled with silent laughter.
``Guilty conscience, eh?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wheezed. ``Follow me.''
Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione, who were both looking worried. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shrugged, and
followed Filch back into the Entrance Hall, against the tide of hungry students.
Filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hummed creakily under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breath as they
climbed the marble staircase. As they reached the first landing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, ``Things are changing
around here, Potter.''
``Ive noticed,'' said Harry coldly.
``Yerse... Ive been telling Dumbledore for years and years he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s too soft with you all,'' said Filch,
chuckling nastily. ``You filthy little beasts would never have dropped Stink Pellets if youd
known I had it in my power to whip you raw, would you, now? Nobody would have thought of
throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I couldve strung you up by the ankles in my
office, would they? But when Educational Decree Number Twenty-nine comes in, Potter, Ill be
allowed to do them things... and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>)s asked the Minister to sign an order for the expulsion of
Peeves... oh, things are going to be very different around here with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) in charge.''
Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) side, Harry thought, and the
worst of it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would probably prove an important weapon; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knowledge of the
schools secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to that of the Weasley
twins.
``Here we are,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, leering down at Harry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rapped three times on Professor Umbridges
door and pushed it open. ``The Potter boy to see you, Maam.''
Umbridges office, so very familiar to Harry from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) many detentions, was the same as usual
except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) desk on which golden letters
spelled the word: HEADMISTRESS. Also, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Firebolt and Fred and Georges Cleansweeps,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw with a pang, were chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the
desk.
Umbridge was sitting behind the desk, busily scribbling on some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) pink parchment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
looked up and smiled widely at their entrance.
``Thank you, Argus,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said sweetly.
``Not at all, Maam, not at all,'' said Filch, bowing as low as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rheumatism would permit, and
exiting backwards.
``Sit,'' said Umbridge curtly, pointing towards a chair. Harry sat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) continued to scribble for a
few moments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watched some of the foul kittens gamboling around the plates over her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) head,
wondering what fresh horror she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Well, now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said finally, setting down her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) quill and surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) complacently, like a toad
about to swallow a particularly juicy fly. ``What would you like to drink?''
``What?'' said Harry, quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had misheard her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
``To drink, Mr. Potter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, smiling still more widely. ``Tea? Coffee? Pumpkin juice?''
As she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) named each drink, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) short wand a wave, and a cup or glass of it appeared on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) desk.
``Nothing, thank you,'' said Harry.
``I wish you to have a drink with me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice becoming dangerously sweet. ``Choose
one.''
``Fine... tea then,'' said Harry, shrugging.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) then bustled
around the desk with it, smiling in a sinisterly sweet fashion.
``There,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, handing it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Drink it before it gets cold, wont you? Well, now, Mr.
Potter... I thought we ought to have a little chat, after the distressing events of last night.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) settled herself back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) seat and waited. When several long moments
had passed in silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said gaily, ``Youre not drinking up!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) raised the cup to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lips and then, just as suddenly, lowered it. One of the horrible painted
kittens behind Umbridge had great round blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moodys magical one and
it had just occurred to Harry what Mad-Eye would say if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mad-Eye</b></font>) ever heard that Harry had drunk
anything offered by a known enemy.
``Whats the matter?'' said Umbridge, who was still watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closely. ``Do you want sugar?''
``No,'' said Harry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) raised the cup to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lips again and pretended to take a sip, though keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth tightly
closed. Umbridges smile widened.
``Good,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) whispered. ``Very good. Now then...'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) leaned forwards a little. ``Where is Albus
Dumbledore?''
``No idea,'' said Harry promptly.
``Drink up, drink up,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, still smiling. ``Now, Mr. Potter, let us not play childish games. I
know that you know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) has gone. You and Dumbledore have been in this together from
the beginning. Consider your position, Mr. Potter...''
``I dont know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) is,'' Harry repeated.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pretended to drink again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very closely.
``Very well,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) looked displeased. ``In that case, you will kindly tell me the
whereabouts of Sirius Black.''
Harrys stomach turned over and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand holding the teacup shook so that it rattled in its saucer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tilted the cup to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid
trickled down on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes.
``I dont know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, a little too quickly.
``Mr. Potter,'' said Umbridge, ``let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal
Black in the Gryffindor fire in October. I know perfectly well it was you he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) was meeting and if I
had had any proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you. I repeat, Mr. Potter...
where is Sirius Black?''
``No idea,'' said Harry loudly. ``Havent got a clue.''
They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes watering. Then Umbridge stood up.
``Very well, Potter, I will take your word for it this time, but be warned: the might of the Ministry
stands behind me. All channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored.
A Floo Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts - except my own, of
course. My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the
castle. And Mr. Filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle. If I find a shred of
evidence...''
BOOM!
The very floor of the office shook. Umbridge slipped sideways, clutching her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) desk for support,
and looking shocked.
``What was -?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was gazing towards the door. Harry took the opportunity to empty his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) almost-full cup of tea
into the nearest vase of dried flowers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear people running and screaming several floors
below.
``Back to lunch you go, Potter!'' cried Umbridge, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand and dashing out of the office.
Harry gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) a few seconds start, then hurried after her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) to see what the source of all the uproar
was.
It was not difficult to find. One floor down, pandemonium reigned. Somebody -LRB-and Harry had a
very shrewd idea who-RRB- had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks.
Dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors,
emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went; shocking-pink Catherine wheels five feet in
diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers; rockets with long
tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls; sparklers were writing swear words in
midair of their own accord; firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked,
and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical
miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watched.
Filch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed in horror, halfway down the stairs. As
Harry watched, one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was
more room to maneuver; it whirled towards Umbridge and Filch with a sinister wheeeeeeeeee.
They both yelled with fright and ducked, and it soared straight out of the window behind them
and off across the grounds. Meanwhile, several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was
smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape towards
the second floor.
``Hurry, Filch, hurry!'' shrieked Umbridge, ``theyll be all over the school unless we do something
- Stupefy''
A jet of red light shot out of the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand and hit one of the rockets. Instead of freezing in
midair, it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy-looking witch in
the middle of a meadow; she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) ran for it just in time, reappearing seconds later squashed into the
next painting, where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>).
``Dont Stun them, Filch!'' shouted Umbridge angrily, for all the world as though it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
incantation.
``Right you are, Headmistress!'' wheezed Filch, who as a Squib could no more have Stunned the
fireworks than swallowed them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom and began
swatting at the fireworks in midair; within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze.
Harry had seen enough; laughing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ducked down low, ran to a door he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew was concealed
behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George
hiding just behind it, listening to Umbridge and Filchs yells and quaking with suppressed mirth.
``Impressive,'' Harry said quietly, grinning. ``Very impressive... youll put Dr. Filibuster out of
business, no problem...''
``Cheers,'' whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face. ``Oh, I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tries
Vanishing them next... they multiply by ten every time you try.''
The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon. Though they
caused plenty of disruption, particularly the firecrackers, the other teachers didnt seem to mind
them very much.
``Dear, dear,'' said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the dragons soared around her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame. ``Miss Brown, would you mind running
along to the Headmistress and informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Headmistress</b></font>) that we have an escaped firework in our
classroom?''
The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) first afternoon as Headmistress
running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom
seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). When the final bell rang and they
were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags, Harry saw, with immense satisfaction, a
disheveled and soot-blackened Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwicks
classroom.
``Thank you so much, Professor!'' said Professor Flitwick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) squeaky little voice. ``I could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of course, but I wasnt sure whether or not I had the authority.''
Beaming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) classroom door in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) snarling face.
Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common room. Even Hermione fought
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) way through the excited crowd to congratulate them.
``They were wonderful fireworks,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said admiringly.
``Thanks,'' said George, looking both surprised and pleased. ``Weasleys Wildfire Whiz-bangs.
Only thing is, we used our whole stock; were going to have to start again from scratch now.''
``It was worth it, though,'' said Fred, who was taking orders from clamouring Gryffindors. ``If you want to add your name to the waiting list, Hermione, its five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty for the Deflagration Deluxe...''
Hermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting staring at their schoolbags as
though hoping their homework would spring out and start doing itself.
``Oh, why dont we have a night off?'' said Hermione brightly, as a silver-tailed Weasley rocket
zoomed past the window. ``After all, the Easter holidays start on Friday, well have plenty of time then.''
``Are you feeling all right?'' Ron asked, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) in disbelief.
``Now you mention it,'' said Hermione happily, ``dyou know... I think Im feeling a
bit... rebellious.''
Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Ron went up to bed
an hour later; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling
out the word TOO.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got into bed, yawning. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses off, the occasional firework passing the window had
become blurred, looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) side, wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) first day in
Dumbledores job, and how Fudge would react when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) heard that the school had spent most of
the day in a state of advanced disruption. Smiling to himself, Harry closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes...
The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more
distant... or perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was simply speeding away from them...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was speeding
towards the plain black door... let it open... let it open...
It did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was inside the circular room lined with doors... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crossed it, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand on an
identical door and it swung inwards...
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking. There were dancing
flecks of light on the walls but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not pause to investigate... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to go on...
There was a door at the far end... it, too, opened at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) touch...
And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church, full of nothing but rows and
rows of towering shelves, each laden with small, dusty, spun-glass spheres... now Harrys heart
was beating fast with excitement... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew where to go... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran forwards, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) footsteps
made no noise in the enormous, deserted room...
There was something in this room he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted very, very much...
Something he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted... or somebody else wanted...
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar was hurting...
BANG!
Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry. The dark dormitory was full of the sound of
laughter.
``Cool!'' said Seamus, who was silhouetted against the window. ``I think one of those Catherine
wheels hit a rocket and its like they mated, come and see!''
Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lay quite still and silent
while the pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar subsided and disappointment washed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt as though a
wonderful treat had been snatched from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at the very last moment... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had got so close that
time.
Glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor
Tower. Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories
below them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach gave a sickening jolt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had Occlumency the
following evening.
Harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) found out how
much further into the Department of Mysteries Harry had penetrated during his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) last dream. With
a surge of guilt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not practiced Occlumency once since their last lesson:
there had been too much going on since Dumbledore had left; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) would not have
been able to empty his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) mind even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had tried. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) doubted, however, whether Snape would
accept that excuse.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good. Hermione
kept asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) what was wrong whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and
emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) brain was not while teachers were firing
review questions at the class.
Resigned to the worst, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) set off for Snapes office after dinner. Halfway across the Entrance
Hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>).
``Over here,'' said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) meeting with Snape, and beckoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
across to the corner of the Entrance Hall where the giant hour-glasses stood. Gryffindors was
now almost empty. ``Are you okay? Umbridge hasnt been asking you about the D.A., has she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)?''
``Oh, no,'' said Cho hurriedly. ``No, it was only... well, I just wanted to say... Harry, I never
dreamed Marietta would tell...''
``Yeah, well,'' said Harry moodily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did feel Cho might have chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) friends a bit more
carefully; it was small consolation that the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital
wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) pimples.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>)s a lovely person really,'' said Cho. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) just made a mistake -''
Harry looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) incredulously.
``A lovely person who made a mistake? She (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) sold us all out, including you!''
``Well... we all got away, didnt we?'' said Cho pleadingly. ``You know, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) mum works for the
Ministry, its really difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>) -''
``Rons dad works for the Ministry too!'' Harry said furiously. ``And in case you hadnt noticed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hasnt got sneak written across his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face -''
``That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Grangers,'' said Cho fiercely. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>) should have
told us she (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>)d jinxed that list -''
``I think it was a brilliant idea,'' said Harry coldly. Cho flushed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) eyes grew brighter.
``Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermiones idea -''
``Dont start crying again,'' said Harry warningly.
``I wasnt going to!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) shouted.
``Yeah... well... good,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``Ive got enough to cope with at the moment.''
``Go and cope with it then!'' Cho said furiously, turning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) heel and stalking off.
Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snapes dungeon and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew from experience
how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) mind if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) arrived angry and resentful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) should have said to Cho about
Marietta before reaching the dungeon door.
``Youre late, Potter,'' said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Snape was standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) back to Harry, removing, as usual, certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thoughts and
placing them carefully in Dumbledores Pensieve. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dropped the last silvery strand into the
stone basin and turned to face Harry.
``So,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``Have you been practicing?''
``Yes,'' Harry lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of Snapes desk.
``Well, well soon find out, wont we?'' said Snape smoothly. ``Wand out, Potter.''
Harry moved into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) usual position, facing Snape with the desk between them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart was
pumping fast with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) mind.
``On the count of three then,'' said Snape lazily. ``One - two -''
Snapes office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in.
``Professor Snape, sir - oh - sorry -''
Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise.
``Its all right, Draco,'' said Snape, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) w and. ``Potter is here for a little remedial Potions.''
Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid.
``I didnt know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, leering at Harry, who knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face was burning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have given
a great deal to be able to shout the truth at Malfoy - or, even better, to hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) with a good curse.
``Well, Draco, what is it?'' asked Snape.
``Its Professor Umbridge, sir - she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) needs your help,'' said Malfoy. ``Theyve found Montague, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)s turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor.''
``How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) get in there?'' demanded Snape.
``I dont know, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)s a bit confused.''
``Very well, very well. Potter,'' said Snape, ``we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) turned and swept from his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) office. Malfoy mouthed, ``Remedial Potions?'' at Harry behind
Snapes back before following him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>).
Seething, Harry replaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes and made to leave the room. At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
twenty-four more hours in which to practice; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ought to feel grateful for the narrow
escape, though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the whole school that he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
needed remedial Potions.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was at the office door when he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) saw it: a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) stopped, and stood looking at it, reminded of something... then he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) remembered: it was a little
like the lights he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) dream last night, the lights in the second room he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had walked
through on his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) journey through the Department of Mysteries.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) turned around. The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting on Snapes desk. The silverwhite contents were ebbing and swirling within. Snapes thoughts... things he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) did not want
Harry to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) broke through Snapes Defenses accidentally...
Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... what was it that Snape was so keen
to hide from Harry?
The silvery lights shivered on the wall... Harry took two steps towards the desk, thinking hard.
Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined
to keep from him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)?
Harry looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart now pumping harder and faster than ever. How long
would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) come straight back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
office afterwards, or accompany Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter... Montague
was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape would want to make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was all right.
Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over it, gazing into its depths. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hesitated, listening, then pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were
completely silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand.
The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it
had become transparent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a
circular window in the ceiling... in fact, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was much mistaken, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was looking down into
the Great Hall.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breath was actually fogging the surface of Snapes thoughts... his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) brain seemed to be in
limbo... it would be insane to do the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was so strongly tempted to do... he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was
trembling... Snape could be back at any moment... but Harry thought of Cho's anger, of
Malfoys jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a great gulp of breath, and plunged his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face into the surface of Snapes thoughts. At
once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping Harry head-first into the Pensieve...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went, and then -
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four house tables were gone. Instead,
there were more than a hundred smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a
student, head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was the scratching of
quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment. It was clearly exam time.
Sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads, which shone chestnut
and copper and gold in the bright light. Harry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here
somewhere... this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) memory...
And there he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared. Snape-the-teenager had a stringy,
pallid look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), like a plant kept in the dark. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair was lank and greasy and was
flopping on to the table, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper:
DEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS - ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL.
So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harrys own age. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand was flying across the
parchment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had written at least a foot more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closest neighbors, and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) writing
was minuscule and cramped.
``Five more minutes!''
The voice made Harry jump. Turning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw the top of Professor Flitwicks head moving
between the desks a short distance away. Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy
black hair... very untidy black hair...
Harry moved so quickly that, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) been solid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have knocked desks flying. Instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
seemed to slide, dreamlike, across two aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boys
head drew nearer and... he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was straightening up now, putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) quill, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) roll of
parchment towards him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) so as to reread what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had written...
Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fifteen-year-old father.
Excitement exploded in the pit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach: it was as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was looking at himself but
with deliberate mistakes. Jamess eyes were hazel, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) nose was slightly longer than Harrys and
there was no scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows;
Jamess hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harrys did, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands could have been Harrys and
Harry could tell that, when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other in height.
James yawned hugely and rumpled up his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) hair, making it even messier than it had been. Then,
with a glance towards Professor Flitwick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) turned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) seat and grinned at a boy sitting four
seats behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).
With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was
lounging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ease, tilting it back on two legs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was very good-looking; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dark
hair fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither Jamess nor Harrys could ever have
achieved, and a girl sitting behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hopefully, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didnt seem to have
noticed. And two seats along from this girl - Harrys stomach gave another pleasurable squirm -
was Remus Lupin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked rather pale and peaky -LRB-was the full moon approaching?-RRB- and was
absorbed in the exam: as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reread his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) answers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chin with the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quill,
frowning slightly.
So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere, too... and sure enough, Harry spotted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) within seconds: a small, mousy-haired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was chewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingernails, staring down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) paper, scuffing the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) toes.
Every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced hopefully at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neighbors paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a
moment, then back at James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had drawn
a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L.E.. What did they stand for?
``Quills down, please!'' squeaked Professor Flitwick. ``That means you too, Stebbins! Please
remain seated while I collect your parchment! Accio!''
Over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwicks outstretched
arms, knocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) backwards off his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) feet. Several people laughed. A couple of students at the
front desks got up, took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) back on to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) feet.
``Thank you... thank you,'' panted Professor Flitwick. ``Very well, everybody, youre free to go!''
Harry looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father, who had hastily crossed out the L.E. he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been
embellishing, jumped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, stuffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quill and the exam paper into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
slung over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>).
Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, moving between the tables towards
the doors to the Entrance Hall, still absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own exam paper. Round-shouldered yet
angular, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) oily hair was jumping
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.
A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James, Sirius and Lupin, and by planting
himself in their midst, Harry managed to keep Snape in sight while straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears to catch the
voices of James and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) friends.
``Did you like question ten, Moony?'' asked Sirius as they emerged into the Entrance Hall.
``Loved it,'' said Lupin briskly. ``Give five signs that identify the werewolf. Excellent question.''
``Dyou think you managed to get all the signs?'' said James in tones of mock concern.
``Think I did,'' said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors
eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. ``One: he (<font color='blue'><b>Stebbins</b></font>)s sitting on my chair. Two: he (<font color='blue'><b>Stebbins</b></font>)s wearing my
clothes. Three: his (<font color='blue'><b>Stebbins</b></font>) names Remus Lupin.''
Wormtail was the only one who didnt laugh.
``I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) said anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``but I couldnt think what else -''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How thick are you, Wormtail?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said James impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``You run round with a werewolf once a

Harry looked anxiously behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) again. Snape remained close by, still buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) exam
questions - but this was Snapes memory and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in
a different direction once outside in the grounds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), Harry, would not be able to follow James
any further. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) intense relief, however, when James and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) three friends strode off down the
lawn towards the lake, Snape followed, still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no
fixed idea of where he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was going. By keeping a little ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), Harry managed to maintain a
close watch on James and the others.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) heard Sirius say. <div class="bookquote">``Ill be surprised if I dont
get Outstanding on it at least.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Me too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch.
<div class="bookquote">``Whered you get that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nicked it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James casually. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) started playing with the Snitch, allowing it to fly as much as
a foot away before seizing it again; his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) reflexes were excellent. Wormtail watched him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) in awe.
They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry, Ron
and Hermione had once spent a Sunday finishing their homework, and threw themselves down
on the grass. Harry looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder yet again and saw, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) delight, that Snape had
settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was as deeply
immersed in the OWL paper as ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the
beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree. The sunlight was dazzling on the
smooth surface of the lake, on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the
Great Hall were sitting, with their shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the water.
Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around at the students milling over
the grass, looking rather haughty and bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing
with the Snitch, letting it zoom further and further away, almost escaping but always grabbed at
the last second. Wormtail was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mouth open. Every time James made a
particularly difficult catch, Wormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry
wondered why James didnt tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but James seemed to be
enjoying the attention. Harry noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father had a habit of rumpling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair as though
to keep it from getting too tidy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) also kept looking over at the girls by the waters edge.
<div class="bookquote">``Put that away, will you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius finally, as James made a fine catch and Wormtail let out a
cheer, <div class="bookquote">``before Wormtail wets himself with excitement.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wormtail</b></font>)</div>Wormtail turned slightly pink, but James grinned.
<div class="bookquote">``If it bothers you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) said, stuffing the Snitch back in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) pocket. Harry had the distinct
impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off.
<div class="bookquote">``Im bored,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``Wish it was full moon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You might,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin darkly from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) book. <div class="bookquote">``Weve still got Transfiguration, if youre
bored you could test me. Here...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) book.
But Sirius snorted. <div class="bookquote">``I dont need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thisll liven you up, Padfoot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Look who it is...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Siriuss head turned. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) became very still, like a dog that has scented a rabbit.
<div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``Snivellus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry turned to see what Sirius was looking at.
Snape was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) feet again, and was stowing the OWL paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) bag. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) left the shadows
of the bushes and set off across the grass, Sirius and James stood up.
Lupin and Wormtail remained sitting: Lupin was still staring down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) book, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) eyes
were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) eyebrows; Wormtail was
looking from Sirius and James to Snape with a look of avid anticipation on his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``All right, Snivellus?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James loudly.
Snape reacted so fast it was as though he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had been expecting an attack: dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) bag, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
plunged his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) hand inside his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) robes and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) wand was halfway into the air when James shouted,
<div class="bookquote">``Expelliarmus!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Snapes wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>).
Sirius let out a bark of laughter.
<div class="bookquote">``Impedimenta!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said, pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wand at Snape, who was knocked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) feet halfway
through a dive towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) own fallen wand.
Students all around had turned to watch. Some of them had got to their feet and were edging
nearer. Some looked apprehensive, others entertained.
Snape lay panting on the ground. James and Sirius advanced on him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), wands raised, James
glancing over his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) shoulder at the girls at the waters edge as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) went. Wormtail was on his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) feet
now, watching hungrily, edging around Lupin to get a clearer view.
<div class="bookquote">``Howd the exam go, Snivelly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James.
<div class="bookquote">``I was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nose was touching the parchment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius viciously. <div class="bookquote">``Therell be
great grease marks all over it, they wont be able to read a word.''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>Several people watching laughed; Snape was clearly unpopular. Wormtail sniggered shrilly.
Snape was trying to get up, but the jinx was still operating on him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was struggling, as though
bound by invisible ropes.
<div class="bookquote">``You - wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) panted, staring up at James with an expression of purest loathing, <div class="bookquote">``you - wait!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait for what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius coolly. <div class="bookquote">``Whatre you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape let out a stream of mixed swear words and hexes, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand ten feet away nothing
happened.
<div class="bookquote">``Wash out your mouth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James coldly. <div class="bookquote">``Scourgify!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pink</b></font>)</div>Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snapes mouth at once; the froth was covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) lips, making
him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) gag, choking him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) -
<div class="bookquote">``Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ALONE!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>James and Sirius looked round. Jamess free hand immediately jumped to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) hair.
It was one of the girls from the lake edge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had thick, dark red hair that fell to her (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) shoulders,
and startlingly green almond-shaped eyes - Harrys eyes.
Harrys mother.
<div class="bookquote">``All right, Evans?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James, and the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more
mature.
<div class="bookquote">``Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div>Lily repeated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was looking a t James with every sign of great dislike.
<div class="bookquote">``Whats he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) done to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James, appearing to deliberate the point, <div class="bookquote">``its more the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) exists, if you
know what I mean...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Many of the surrounding students laughed, Sirius and Wormtail included, but Lupin, still
apparently intent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) book, didnt, and nor did Lily.
<div class="bookquote">``You think youre funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) said coldly. <div class="bookquote">``But youre just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Potter.
Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will if you go out with me, Evans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Go on... go out with me and Ill never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), the Impediment Jinx was wearing off. Snape was beginning to inch towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) crawled.
<div class="bookquote">``I wouldnt go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div>said Lily.
<div class="bookquote">``Bad luck, Prongs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius briskly, and turned back to Snape. <div class="bookquote">``Oy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But too late; Snape had directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash
appeared on the side of Jamess face, spattering his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) robes with blood. James whirled about: a
second flash of light later, Snape was hanging upside-down in the air, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) robes falling over his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of graying underpants.
Many people in the small crowd cheered; Sirius, James and Wormtail roared with laughter.
Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was going to smile,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) down!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) wand upwards; Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the
ground. Disentangling himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) robes he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) got quickly to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) feet, wand up, but Sirius said, <div class="bookquote">``Locomotor mortis!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>and Snape keeled over again at once, rigid as a board.
<div class="bookquote">``LEAVE HIM ALONE!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div>Lily shouted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) own wand out now. James and Sirius eyed it warily.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, Evans, dont make me hex you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James earnestly.
<div class="bookquote">``Take the curse off him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>), then!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the counter-curse.
<div class="bookquote">``There you go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) said, as Snape struggled to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Youre lucky Evans was here, Snivellus
--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her (<font color='blue'><b>HIM</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div>Lily blinked.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) said coolly. <div class="bookquote">``I wont bother in future. And Id wash your pants if I were you, Snivellus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Apologize to Evans!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>James roared at Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) wand pointed threateningly at him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I dont want you to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) apologize,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div>Lily shouted, rounding on James. <div class="bookquote">``Youre as bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>Evans</b></font>) is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>yelped James. <div class="bookquote">``Id NEVER call you a - you-know-what!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like youve just got off your
broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who
annoys you just because you can - Im surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that
fat head on it. You make me SICK.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) heel and hurried away.
<div class="bookquote">``Evans!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>James shouted after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Hey, EVANS!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) didnt look back.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway
question of no real importance to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Reading between the lines, Id say she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thinks youre a bit conceited, mate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said James, who looked furious now, <div class="bookquote">``right -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside-down in the air.
<div class="bookquote">``Who wants to see me take off Snivellys pants?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>But whether James really did take off Snapes pants, Harry never found out. A hand had closed
tight over his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) upper arm, closed with a pincer-like grip. Wincing, Harry looked round to see who
had hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape standing right
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), white with rage.
<div class="bookquote">``Having fun?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry felt himself rising into the air; the summers day evaporated around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was floating
upwards through icy blackness, Snapes hand still tight upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) upper arm. Then, with a
swooping feeling as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had turned head-over-heels in midair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) feet hit the stone floor
of Snapes dungeon and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snapes desk in the
shadowy, present-day Potion masters study.
<div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, gripping Harrys arm so tightly Harrys hand was starting to feel numb. <div class="bookquote">``So...
been enjoying yourself, Potter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``N-no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, trying to free his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm.
It was scary: Snapes lips were shaking, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) face was white, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) teeth were bared.
<div class="bookquote">``Amusing man, your father, wasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, shaking Harry so hard his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) glasses slipped
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) nose.
<div class="bookquote">``I - didnt -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape threw Harry from him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) might. Harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor.
<div class="bookquote">``You will not repeat what you saw to anybody!''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape bellowed.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, getting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet as far from Snape as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``No, of course I w--''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get out, get out, I dont want to see you in this office ever again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>And as Harry hurtled towards the door, a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wrenched the door open and flew along the corridor, stopping only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had put three floors
between himself and Snape. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) leaned against the wall, panting, and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) bruised
arm.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor to tell Ron and Hermione what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had just seen. What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at
or having jars thrown at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a
circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape had felt as his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) father had taunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), and that
judging from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had just seen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had
always told him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>).

<div class="bookquote">``But why havent you got Occlumency lessons any more?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, frowning.
<div class="bookquote">``Ive told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now Ive got the basics.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So youve stopped having funny dreams?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione skeptically.
<div class="bookquote">``Pretty much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I dont think Snape should stop until youre absolutely sure you can control them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said
Hermione indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``Harry, I think you should go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and ask -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry forcefully. <div class="bookquote">``Just drop it, Hermione, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) custom, had spent a large
part of the day drawing up study schedule for the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
do it; it was easier than arguing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and, in any case, they might come in useful.
Ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams.
<div class="bookquote">``How can that come as a shock?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione demanded, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) tapped each little square on Rons
schedule with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand so that it flashed a different color according to its subject.
<div class="bookquote">``I dunno,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, <div class="bookquote">``theres been a lot going on. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, there you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) timetable, <div class="bookquote">``if you follow that you should do
fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.
<div class="bookquote">``Youve given me an evening off every week!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats for Quidditch practice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.
The smile faded from Rons face.
<div class="bookquote">``Whats the point?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said dully. <div class="bookquote">``Weve got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch
Cup this year as Dads got of becoming Minister for Magic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione said nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was looking at Harry, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall
of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand, trying to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears scratched.
<div class="bookquote">``Whats wrong, Harry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) up as a bad job and slunk away under Hermiones chair.
<div class="bookquote">``I saw Cho earlier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione tentatively. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked really miserable, too... have you two had a row again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wha -- oh, yeah, we have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse.
<div class="bookquote">``What about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, well, I dont blame you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron angrily, setting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) revision timetable. <div class="bookquote">``If it
hadnt been for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marietta</b></font>)...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry found helpful; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to do was
look angry, nod and say <div class="bookquote">``Yeah''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Thats right''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mind
free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had seen in the Pensieve.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) felt as though the memory of it was eating him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) from inside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had been so sure his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) parents
were wonderful people that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the
aspersions Snape cast on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) fathers character. Hadnt people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry
how wonderful his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father had been? -LRB-Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a
nagging voice inside Harrys head... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was as bad, wasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?-RRB- Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had once overheard
Professor McGonagall saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and
George dangling someone upside-down for the fun of it... not unless they really loathed them...
perhaps Malfoy, or somebody who really deserved it...
Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had suffered at Jamess hands: but
hadnt Lily asked, <div class="bookquote">``Whats he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) done to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lily</b></font>)</div>And hadnt James replied, <div class="bookquote">``Its more the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) exists, if you know what I mean.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Hadnt James started it all simply because Sirius had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) prefect in the hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be able to exercise some control over James and
Sirius... but in the Pensieve, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had sat there and let it all happen...
Harry kept reminding himself that Lily had intervened; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother had been decent. Yet, the
memory of the look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had shouted at James disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) quite as much as
anything else; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had clearly loathed James, and Harry simply could not understand how they
could have ended up married. Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) even wondered whether James had forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>)
into it...
For nearly five years the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration.
Whenever someone had told him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was like James, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had glowed with pride inside. And
now... now he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) felt cold and miserable at the thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>).
The weather grew breezier, brighter and warmer as the Easter holidays passed, but Harry, along
with the rest of the fifth- and seventh-years, was trapped inside, traipsing back and forth
to the library. Harry pretended his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) excuse went unchallenged.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, Im talking to you, can you hear me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Huh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked round. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at the library table
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been sitting alone. It was late on Sunday evening: Hermione had gone back to
Gryffindor Tower to review Ancient Runes, and Ron had Quidditch practice.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) books towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How come youre not at practice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny. <div class="bookquote">``Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, were not sure, but we think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) knocked himself out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own bat.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) sighed heavily. <div class="bookquote">``Anyway... a package just arrived, its only just got through Umbridges new screening process.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table; it had clearly been unwrapped and
carelessly re-wrapped. There was a scribbled note across it in red ink, reading: Inspected and
Passed by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor.
<div class="bookquote">``Its Easter eggs from Mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny. <div class="bookquote">``Theres one for you... there you go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small, iced Snitches and, according to
the packaging, containing a bag of Fizzing Whizzbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) horror, felt a lump rise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you okay, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>Ginny asked quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Im fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry gruffly. The lump in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat was painful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not understand
why an Easter egg should have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feel like this.
<div class="bookquote">``You seem really down lately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>Ginny persisted. <div class="bookquote">``You know, Im sure if you just talked to Cho...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its not Cho I want to talk to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry brusquely.
<div class="bookquote">``Who is it, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>asked Ginny, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closely.
<div class="bookquote">``I...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening. Madam Pince was several shelves
away, stamping out a pile of books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish I could talk to Sirius,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``But I know I cant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>Ginny continued to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thoughtfully. More to give himself something to do than because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) really wanted any, Harry unwrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Easter egg, broke off a large bit and put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too, <div class="bookquote">``if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry dully. <div class="bookquote">``With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The thing about growing up with Fred and George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``is that you sort of start thinking anythings possible if youve got enough nerve.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>Harry looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>). Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate - Lupin had always advised eating
some after encounters with Dementors - or simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) had finally spoken aloud the wish
that had been burning inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) for a week, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) felt a bit more hopeful.
<div class="bookquote">``WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh damn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>whispered Ginny, jumping to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``I forgot -''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Madam Pince was swooping down on them, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) shriveled face contorted with rage.
<div class="bookquote">``Chocolate in the library!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) screamed. <div class="bookquote">``Out - out - OUT!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And whipping out her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) wand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)
caused Harrys books, bag and ink bottle to chase him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Ginny from the library, whacking
them repeatedly over the head as they ran.
As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations, a batch of pamphlets,
leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor
Tower shortly before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the board, which
read:
All fifth-years are required to attend a short meeting with their Head of House during the first
week of the summer term to discuss their future careers. Times of individual appointments are
listed below.
Harry looked down the list and found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was expected in Professor McGonagalls office at
half past two on Monday, which would mean missing most of Divination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and the other fifth years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I dont fancy Healing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron on the last evening of the holidays. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was immersed in
a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St. Mungos on its front. <div class="bookquote">``It says here you need at least E at NEWT level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms and Defense Against the Dark Arts. I mean... blimey... dont want much, do they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, its a very responsible job, isnt it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione absently.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet that was headed, SO YOU THINK YOUD
LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS?
<div class="bookquote">``You dont seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Youd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry darkly. <div class="bookquote">``Good
sense of when to duck, more like.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking.
<div class="bookquote">``Listen to this: Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial,
danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who
are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad... They want
Arithmancy, though; you could do it, Hermione!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont much fancy banking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: HAVE YOU GOT
WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?
<div class="bookquote">``Hey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said a voice in Harrys ear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked round; Fred and George had come to join them.
<div class="bookquote">``Ginnys had a word with us about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) legs on the table in front of
them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the
floor. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) says you need to talk to Sirius?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione sharply, freezing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand halfway towards picking up MAKE A
BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, trying to sound casual, <div class="bookquote">``yeah, I thought Id like -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont be so ridiculous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, we think we can find a way around that,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, stretching and smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Its a
simple matter of causing a diversion. Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather
quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>continued Fred. <div class="bookquote">``No point
at all, we answered ourselves. And of course, wed have messed up peoples studying, too, which
would be the very last thing wed want to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked rather taken aback by this
thoughtfulness.
<div class="bookquote">``But its business as usual from tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred continued briskly. <div class="bookquote">``And if were going to be
causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chat with Sirius?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody
very obtuse, <div class="bookquote">``even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Umbridges office,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quietly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative. Umbridge
herself had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that the only fire that was not being watched was her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) own.
<div class="bookquote">``Are - you - insane?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a hushed voice.
Ron had lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) leaflet on jobs in the Cultivated Fungus Trade and was watching the
conversation warily.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, shrugging.
<div class="bookquote">``And how are you going to get in there in the first place?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry was ready for this question.
<div class="bookquote">``Siriuss knife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Excuse me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife thatll open any lock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``So even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s bewitched the door so Alohomora wont work, which I bet she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) has -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you think about this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded
irresistibly of Mrs. Weasley appealing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) husband during Harrys first dinner in Grimmauld
Place.
<div class="bookquote">``I dunno,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion. <div class="bookquote">``If Harry wants to do it,
its up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), isnt it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back. <div class="bookquote">``Right, then.
Were thinking of doing it tomorrow, just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact
if everybodys in the corridors - Harry, well set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) right
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) own office -- I reckon we should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty
minutes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, looking at George.
<div class="bookquote">``Easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.
<div class="bookquote">``What sort of diversion is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Youll see, little bro,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) and George got up again. <div class="bookquote">``At least, you will if you trot
along to Gregory the Smarmys corridor round about five oclock tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done on the morning of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It was not only the prospect of breaking into
Umbridges office and using her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) fire to speak to Sirius that was making him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) feel nervous, though
that was certainly bad enough; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close
proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) office.
After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved
across to the window beside Nevilles bed, and stared out on a truly glorious morning. The sky
was a clear, misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Harry could see the towering beech
tree below which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father had once tormented Snape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not sure what Sirius could
possibly say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) that would make up for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had seen in the Pensieve, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was
desperate to hear Siriuss own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors
there might have been, any excuse at all for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) fathers behavior...
Something caught Harrys attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry
squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed to be limping.
As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cabin and disappeared inside it. Harry
watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the
chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was unequal to stoking the fire.
Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk and started to dress.
With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridges office ahead, Harry had never expected the
day to be a restful one, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not reckoned on Hermiones almost continual attempts to
dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was planning to do at five oclock. For the first time ever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was at
least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a
stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.
<div class="bookquote">''... and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)ll be able to guess youve
been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) questions...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron in a low and indignant voice, <div class="bookquote">``are you going to stop telling Harry off and
listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You take notes for a change, it wont kill you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione.
Undeterred, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire
warnings, all uttered under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole
minutes checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) cauldron for leaks.
Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of
course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernons favorites, and on the whole was
grateful he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) usually had to endure from
Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) found the new approach something of an
improvement, and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was able to concoct an
Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) scooped some of the potion into a
flask, corked it and took it up to Snapes desk for marking, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) might at last have
scraped an E.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had just turned away when he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) heard a smashing noise. Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter.
Harry whipped around. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with a look of gloating pleasure.
<div class="bookquote">``Whoops,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``Another zero, then, Potter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry was too incensed to speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strode back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cauldron, intending to fill another flask
and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.
<div class="bookquote">``Im sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``Im really sorry, Harry. I thought
youd finished, so I cleared up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hurried out of the dungeon
without a backwards glance, and made sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found himself a seat between Neville and
Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) again about using Umbridges
office.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) was in such a bad mood by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) got to Divination that he (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) had quite forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>)
careers appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering it only when Ron asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) why
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wasnt in her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes
late.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry, Professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) panted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) closed the door. <div class="bookquote">``I forgot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No matter, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said briskly, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner.
Harry looked round.
Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
neck and a small, horribly smug smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) hands shook slightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) shuffled
the many pamphlets littering her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) desk.
Harry sat down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back to Umbridge and did his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) best to pretend he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not hear the
scratching of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) quill on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you
decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor
McGonagall. <div class="bookquote">``Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave
Hogwarts?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Er -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was finding the scratching noise from behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very distracting.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry mumbled.
<div class="bookquote">``Youd need top grades for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet
from under the mass on her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) desk and opening it. <div class="bookquote">``They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and
nothing under Exceeds Expectations grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. Its a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best. In fact, I dont think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>At this moment, Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was trying to see
how quietly she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Youll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) went on, talking a little
louder than before.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Defense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Naturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall crisply. <div class="bookquote">``I would also advise -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time. Professor McGonagall
closed her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had
happened.
<div class="bookquote">``I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or
Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into
my NEWT classes unless they have achieved Exceeds Expectations or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. Id say youre averaging Acceptable at the moment, so youll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) added, with the merest flicker of a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than Outstanding in their OWLs, so -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridge gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) most pronounced cough yet.
<div class="bookquote">``May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, thank you very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much.
<div class="bookquote">``I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I daresay youll find you can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth.
<div class="bookquote">``I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge sweetly.
<div class="bookquote">``Were you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall haughtily. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) continued, as though there had been no interruption, <div class="bookquote">``if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between Acceptable and Exceeds Expectations for the last two years, so your Charmwork seems satisfactory. As for Defense Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you - are you quite sure you wouldnt like a cough drop, Dolores!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
loudest yet. <div class="bookquote">``I was just concerned that you might not have Harrys most recent Defense Against
the Dark Arts marks in front of you. Im quite sure I slipped in a note.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, this thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) pulled a sheet of
pink parchment from between the leaves of Harrys folder. She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) glanced down it, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) eyebrows
slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the
subject, and obviously for an Auror -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you not understand my note, Minerva?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>asked Professor Umbridge in honeyed tones, quite
forgetting to cough.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course I understood it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) teeth clenched so tightly the words
came out a little muffled.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I am confused... Im afraid I dont quite understand how you can give Mr. Potter
false hope that -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``False hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor
Umbridge. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) has achieved high marks in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) Defense Against the Dark Arts tests -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry
has been achieving very poor results in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) classes with me -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should have made my meaning plainer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look
Umbridge directly in the eyes. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts
tests set by a competent teacher.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Umbridges smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) sat back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
chair, turned a sheet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) bulging eyes
rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) thin nostrils flared, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)
eyes burning.
<div class="bookquote">``Any questions, Potter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough NEWTs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, youll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said
Professor McGonagall, <div class="bookquote">``perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further
three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defense. It will mean a lot more study
even after youve left school, so unless youre prepared to -''
 (<font color='red'><b>McGonagall/Minerva/Minerva McGonagall</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think youll also find,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) voice very cold now, <div class="bookquote">``that the Ministry looks into
the records of those applying to be Aurors. Their criminal records.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''- unless youre prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at
another -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of
ever returning to this school.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A very good chance, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter has a criminal record,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge loudly.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter has been cleared of all charges,''  (<font color='red'><b>McGonagall/Minerva/Minerva McGonagall</b></font>)</div>said McGonagall, even more loudly.
Professor Umbridge stood up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) fussy, simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) broad, flabby
face look oddly sinister.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall got to her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) feet, too, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) case this was a much more impressive
move; she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) towered over Professor Umbridge.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said in ringing tones, <div class="bookquote">``I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice rising
furiously.
<div class="bookquote">``There may well be a new Minister for Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>shouted
Professor McGonagall.
<div class="bookquote">``Aha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby finger at McGonagall. <div class="bookquote">``Yes! Yes, yes,
yes! Of course! Thats what you want, isnt it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge
replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think youll be where I am, dont you: Senior
Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are raving,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. <div class="bookquote">``Potter, that concludes our
careers consultation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at
Professor Umbridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each
other all the way back along the corridor.
Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had just run a race when she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) strode into
their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.
<div class="bookquote">``I hope youve thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation.
<div class="bookquote">``Umbridge looks like she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s in a really bad mood already...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head down, staring
at Defensive Magical Theory, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes unfocused, thinking...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could just imagine Professor McGonagalls reaction if he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was caught trespassing in Professor
Umbridges office mere hours after she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had vouched for him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)... there was nothing to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer
holidays he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had witnessed in the
Pensieve... nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) stomach... and then there was the matter of
Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), which was currently residing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) schoolbag along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) fathers old Invisibility
Cloak.
But the fact remained that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was caught...
<div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whispered Hermione, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
book to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face from Umbridge. <div class="bookquote">``And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for
nothing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) father had done
on a summers day more than twenty years ago...
And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room...
Youre less like your father than I thought... the risk wouldve been what made it fun for
James...
But did he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) want to be like his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) father any more?
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, dont do it, please dont do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the
end of the class.
He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did not answer; he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did not know what to do.
Ron seemed determined to give neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) opinion nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) advice; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) would not look at Harry,
though when Hermione opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said in a low
voice, <div class="bookquote">``Give it a rest, okay? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Harrys heart beat very fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left the classroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was halfway along the corridor outside
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard the unmistakable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance. There were
screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them; people exiting the classrooms all
around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully -
Umbridge came pelting out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) classroom as fast as her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) short legs would carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). Pulling out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hurried off in the opposite direction: it was now or never.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry - please!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione pleaded weakly.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind; hitching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag more securely on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) set off at a
run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the
fuss was about in the east wing.
Harry reached the corridor to Umbridges office and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large
suit of armor whose helmet creaked around to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled open his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag, seized Siriuss knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the corridor until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached Umbridges door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and
down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny click, and the door swung open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ducked inside the
office, closed the door quickly behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and looked around.
Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above
the confiscated broomsticks.
Harry pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was looking for
within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crouched down in front of the empty grate, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands shaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never done this before,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew how it must work. Sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head into the fireplace, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a large
pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). They exploded at once
into emerald green flames.
<div class="bookquote">``Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said loudly and clearly.
It was one of the most curious sensations he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ever experienced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had traveled by Floo
powder before, of course, but then it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) entire body that had spun around and around in
the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country. This time,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridges office, and only his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head hurtled
through the emerald fire...
And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling rather sick and as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring
over a piece of parchment.
<div class="bookquote">``Sirius?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) said, looking thoroughly shocked. <div class="bookquote">``What are you - whats happened, is everything all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I just wondered -- I mean, I just fancied a - a chat with Sirius.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ill call him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, getting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, still looking perplexed, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) seems to be hiding in the attic again...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was left with nothing to look at but the
chair and table legs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it
was to speak out of the fire; his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact
with Umbridges hard stone floor.
Lupin returned with Sirius at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) heels moments later.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius urgently, sweeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) long dark hair out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) eyes and dropping to the
ground in front of the fire, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) and Harry were on a level. Lupin knelt down too, looking
very concerned. <div class="bookquote">``Are you all right? Do you need help?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``its nothing like that... I just wanted to talk... about my dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or
embarrassed; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees were becoming sorer by the second and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) guessed five minutes had
already passed from the start of the diversion; George had only guaranteed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) twenty. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had seen in the Pensieve.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment. Then Lupin said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``I
wouldnt like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was only fifteen -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im fifteen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry heatedly.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, Harry''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius placatingly, <div class="bookquote">``James and Snape hated each other from the moment they
set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, cant you? I think
James was everything Snape wanted to be - he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was popular, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was good at Quidditch - good at
pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes in the
Dark Arts, and James - whatever else he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) may have appeared to you, Harry - always hated the
Dark Arts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because - well, just
because you said you were bored,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finished, with a slightly apologetic note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Im not proud of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius quickly.
Lupin looked sideways at Sirius, then said, <div class="bookquote">``Look, Harry, what youve got to understand is that
your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they
were the height of cool - if they sometimes got a bit carried away -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius.
Lupin smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) kept messing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) hair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry in a pained voice.
Sirius and Lupin laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``Id forgotten he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) used to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius affectionately.
<div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) playing with the Snitch?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin eagerly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently.
<div class="bookquote">``Well... I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was a bit of an idiot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was a bit of an idiot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius bracingly, <div class="bookquote">``we were all idiots! Well - not Moony
so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said fairly, looking at Lupin.
But Lupin shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Did I ever have the
guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, <div class="bookquote">``you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes... that was
something...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was here, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, shrugging,
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) couldnt stop himself showing off whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) got near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How come she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked miserably. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) didnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) started going out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) in seventh year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin.
<div class="bookquote">``Once James had deflated his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) head a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin.
<div class="bookquote">``Even Snape?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin slowly, <div class="bookquote">``Snape was a special case I mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) never lost an opportunity to
curse James so you couldnt really expect James to take that lying down, could you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And my mum was okay with that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) didnt know too much about it, to tell you the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, James didnt take
Snape on dates with her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) and jinx him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>), did he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.
<div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``your father was the best friend I ever had and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a good person. A lot of
people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grew out of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry heavily. <div class="bookquote">``I just never thought Id feel sorry for Snape.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now you mention it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, a faint crease between his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) eyebrows, <div class="bookquote">``how did Snape react
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) found youd seen all this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)d never teach me Occlumency again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry indifferently, <div class="bookquote">``like thats a big
disappoint--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) WHAT?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you serious, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin quickly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s stopped giving you lessons?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, surprised at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) considered a great over-reaction. <div class="bookquote">``But its okay, I dont
care, its a bit of a relief to tell you the -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im coming up there to have a word with Snape!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius forcefully, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) back down again.
<div class="bookquote">``If anyones going to tell Snape it will be me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) said firmly. <div class="bookquote">``But Harry, first of all, youre to
go back to Snape and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) that on no account is he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) to stop giving you lessons -- when
Dumbledore hears -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cant tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)d kill me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, outraged. <div class="bookquote">``You didnt see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) when we got out of the Pensieve.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin sternly. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
understand me? Nothing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay, okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed. <div class="bookquote">``Ill... Ill try and say something to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... but it wont be-''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear distant footsteps.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Sirius, glancing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It must be somebody your end.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Harrys heart skipped
several beats.
<div class="bookquote">``Id better go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said hastily and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) head backwards out of the Grimmauld Place fire. For a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) head seemed to be revolving on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) shoulders, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) found himself kneeling in front of Umbridges fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die.
<div class="bookquote">``Quickly, quickly!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)s left
it open -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when
Filch burst into the office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to
himself feverishly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridges desk and began
rifling through the papers inside it.
<div class="bookquote">``Approval for Whipping... Approval for Whipping... I can do it at last... theyve had it coming
to them for years...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door,
clutching it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest.
Harry leapt to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet and, making sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was
completely covering him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch,
who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) go.
One landing down from Umbridges office, Harry thought it was safe to become visible again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag and hurried onwards. There was a great deal of
shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran down the marble staircase and
found what looked like most of the school assembled there.
It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the
walls in a great ring -LRB-some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like
Stinksap-RRB-; teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the onlookers were
members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves,
and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the
middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been cornered.
<div class="bookquote">``So!''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge triumphantly. Harry realized she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was standing just a few stairs in front of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), once more looking down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) prey. <div class="bookquote">``So - you think it amusing to turn a school corridor
into a swamp, do you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pretty amusing, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) without the slightest sign of fear.
Filch elbowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness.
<div class="bookquote">``Ive got the form, Headmistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had
just seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) take from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) desk. <div class="bookquote">``Ive got the form and Ive got the whips waiting... oh, let me
do it now...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very good, Argus,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You two,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) went on, gazing down at Fred and George, <div class="bookquote">``are
about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``I dont think we are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) twin.
<div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, <div class="bookquote">``I think weve outgrown full-time education.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Ive been feeling that way myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George lightly.
<div class="bookquote">``Time to test our talents in the real world, dyou reckon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>asked Fred.
<div class="bookquote">``Definitely,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.
And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together:
<div class="bookquote">``Accio brooms!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ducked just in time.
Fred and Georges broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which
Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners;
they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain
clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.
<div class="bookquote">``We wont be seeing you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) leg over his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) broomstick.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, dont bother to keep in touch,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, mounting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own.
Fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd.
<div class="bookquote">``If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley - Weasleys Wizarding Wheezes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said in a loud voice. <div class="bookquote">``Our new
premises!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear theyre going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley</b></font>)</div>added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge.
<div class="bookquote">``STOP THEM!''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in,
Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg
swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) level
above the crowd.
<div class="bookquote">``Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasleys</b></font>) hell from us, Peeves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) belled hat
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause
from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.
CHAPTER THIRTY
Grawp
The story of Fred and Georges flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that
Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend: within a week, even those
who had been eye-witnesses were half-convinced they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge
on their brooms and pelt her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate
aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them. Harry frequently
heard students saying things like, <div class="bookquote">``Honestly some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and
leaving this place,''  (<font color='red'><b>students</b></font>)</div>or else, <div class="bookquote">``One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley.''
 (<font color='red'><b>students</b></font>)</div>Fred and George had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon. For one thing, they
had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth
floor of the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of
removing it but without success. Eventually the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) teeth
furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain
that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but, just
as in the case of Fred and Georges Wildfire Whiz-bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch
Umbridge struggle.
Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridges office door, through which
Fred and Georges Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and
removed Harrys Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumored, Umbridge had set an armed
security troll to guard it. However, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) troubles were far from over.
Inspired by Fred and Georges example, a great number of students were now vying for the
newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed
to slip a hairy-snouted Niffler into Umbridges office, which promptly tore the place apart in its
search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge when she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
stubby fingers. Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it
became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms on themselves before
leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh air, even though it gave them all the
peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.
Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) hands, desperate to catch miscreants,
but the problem was that there were now so many of them he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) never knew which way to turn. The
Inquisitorial Squad was attempting to help him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), but odd things kept happening to its members.
Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin
complaint that made him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) look as though he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had been coated in cornflakes; Pansy Parkinson, to
Hermiones delight, missed all her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) lessons the following day as she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had sprouted antlers.
Meanwhile, it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed
to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge only had to enter her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) classroom for the students
assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers or else spout blood from both nostrils.
Shrieking with rage and frustration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their
source, but the students told her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) stubbornly they were suffering from Umbridge -itis. After
putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was forced to
give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating and vomiting students to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) classes in
droves.
But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos, Peeves, who
seemed to have taken Freds parting words deeply to heart. Cackling madly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) soared through
the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, toppling statues and vases; twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
shut Mrs. Norris inside a suit of armor, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was rescued, yowling loudly, by the
furious caretaker. Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over
the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or
out of windows; flooded the second floor when he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms,
dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)
fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries
every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) spoke.
None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). Indeed, a week after
Fred and Georges departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves,
who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) tell the
poltergeist out of the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) mouth, <div class="bookquote">``It unscrews the other way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the poltergeist</b></font>)</div>To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sojourn in the toilet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remained
confused and disorientated and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up
the front drive, looking extremely angry.
<div class="bookquote">``Should we say something?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a worried voice, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cheek against the
Charms window so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could see Mr. and Mrs. Montague marching inside. <div class="bookquote">``About what
happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Course not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)ll recover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron indifferently.
<div class="bookquote">``Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isnt it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry in a satisfied voice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands.
Harrys spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in
midair. Rons grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great
difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the cup to crack into two.
<div class="bookquote">``Reparo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quickly, mending Rons cup with a wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand. <div class="bookquote">``Thats all very
well, but what if Montagues permanently injured?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who cares?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron irritably, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) teacup stood up drunkenly again, trembling violently
at the knees. <div class="bookquote">``Montague shouldnt have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)?
If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs, and replacing it in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why should I be worried about you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When Mums next letter finally gets through Umbridges screening process,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron bitterly,
now holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, <div class="bookquote">``Im going to be in
deep trouble. I wouldnt be surprised if she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s sent another Howler.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Itll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron darkly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)ll say I shouldve
stopped them leaving, I shouldve grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something...
yeah, itll be all my fault.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) does say that itll be very unfair, you couldnt have done anything! But Im sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wont, I mean, if its really true theyve got premises in Diagon Alley, they must have been
planning this for ages.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, but thats another thing, how did they get premises?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, hitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) teacup so hard
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Its a bit dodgy isnt
it? Theyll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)ll want to
know what theyve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, that occurred to me, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) teacup to jog in neat little
circles around Harrys, whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop, <div class="bookquote">``Ive been
wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mundungus</b></font>) hasnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry curtly.
<div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron and Hermione together.
<div class="bookquote">``Because -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come. There was
no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were
criminals. <div class="bookquote">``Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>There was a shocked silence, then Hermiones teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and
smashed on the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Harry, you didnt!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry mutinously. <div class="bookquote">``And I dont regret it, either. I didnt need the gold and
theyll be great at running a joke shop.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But this is excellent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking thrilled. <div class="bookquote">``Its all your fault, Harry - Mum cant blame
me at all! Can I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I suppose youd better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry dully, <div class="bookquote">``specially if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) thinks theyre receiving stolen
cauldrons or something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but Harry had a shrewd suspicion that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
self-restraint was bound to crack before long. Sure enough, once they had left the castle for break
and were standing around in the weak May sunshine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) fixed Harry with a beady eye and
opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth with a determined air.
Harry interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had even started.
<div class="bookquote">``Its no good nagging me, its done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Fred and George have got the gold - spent a good bit of it, too, by the sounds of it - and I cant get it back from them and I dont want to. So
save your breath, Hermione.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wasnt going to say anything about Fred and George!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said in an injured voice.
Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) a very dirty look.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I wasnt!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said angrily. <div class="bookquote">``As a matter of fact, I was going to ask Harry when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s going
to go back to Snape and ask for more Occlumency lessons!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harrys heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and Georges dramatic
departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news
of Sirius. As Harry had not confided in them the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first
place, it had been hard to think of what to tell them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ended up saying, truthfully, that
Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been regretting this ever since;
Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it.
<div class="bookquote">``You cant tell me youve stopped having funny dreams,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione said now, <div class="bookquote">``because Ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Harry threw Ron a furious look. Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself.
<div class="bookquote">``You were only muttering a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mumbled apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``Something about just a bit
further.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry lied brutally. <div class="bookquote">``I was trying to get you
to stretch out a bit further to grab the Quaffle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Rons ears went red. Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not, of course, dreamed
anything of the sort.
Last night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had passed through the circular room, then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass
spheres.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had hurried straight towards row number ninety-seven, turned left, and ran along it... it had
probably been then that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had spoken aloud... just a bit further... for he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) conscious self
struggling to wake... and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had reached the end of the row, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had found himself lying
in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) four-poster.
<div class="bookquote">``You are trying to block your mind, arent you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking beadily at Harry. <div class="bookquote">``You
are keeping going with your Occlumency?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, trying to sound as though this question was insulting, but not quite
meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eye. The truth was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room
full of dusty orbs, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was quite keen for the dreams to continue.
The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment
devoted to revision, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind seemed so saturated with information when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went to bed he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
found it very difficult to get to sleep at all; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) overwrought brain presented
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) most nights with stupid dreams about the exams. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) also suspected that part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind -
the part that often spoke in Hermiones voice -- now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down
that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could reach the
journeys end.
<div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, <div class="bookquote">``if Montague doesnt recover before
Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I spose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, glad of a change of subject.
<div class="bookquote">``I mean, weve won one, lost one - if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, thats right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, losing track of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was agreeing to. Cho Chang had just
walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>).
The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was to take place on the
last weekend of May. Although Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last
match, Gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory, due mainly -LRB-though of course nobody said
it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>)-RRB- to Rons abysmal goal-keeping record. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), however, seemed to have found a new
optimism.
<div class="bookquote">``I mean, I cant get any worse, can I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the
morning of the match. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing to lose now, is there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst
of a very excitable crowd, <div class="bookquote">``I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around. They
never exactly gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) a lot of confidence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, gosh, I forgot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked
serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins. <div class="bookquote">``Cho will be playing, wont she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted.
They found seats in the topmost row of the stands. It was a fine, clear day; Ron could not wish
for better, and Harry found himself hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins
cause for more rousing choruses of Weasley is our King.
Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George had left, was commentating as
usual. As the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) named the players with something less than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) usual gusto.
<div class="bookquote">''... Bradley... Davies... Chang,''  (<font color='red'><b>the players</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) said, and Harry felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach perform, less of a back flip,
more a feeble lurch as Cho walked out on to the pitch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shiny black hair rippling in the slight
breeze. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) was not sure what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) wanted to happen any more, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) could not stand any
more rows. Even the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chatting animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount
their brooms caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) only a slight twinge of jealousy.
<div class="bookquote">``And theyre off!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan</b></font>)</div>said Lee. <div class="bookquote">``And Davies takes the Quaffle immediately, Ravenclaw Captain
Davies with the Quaffle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) dodges Johnson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) dodges Bell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) dodges Spinnet as well... he (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>)s
going straight for goal! He (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>)s going to shoot - and - and -''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan</b></font>)</div>Lee swore very loudly. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>)s
scored.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors. Predictably, horribly, the
Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing: <div class="bookquote">``Weasley cannot save a thing He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) cannot block a single ring...''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Slytherins</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry''  (<font color='red'><b>the Slytherins</b></font>)</div>said a hoarse voice in Harrys ear. <div class="bookquote">``Hermione...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry looked round and saw Hagrids enormous bearded face sticking between the seats.
Apparently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way all along the row behind, for the first- and second-years he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had just passed had a ruffled, flattened look about them. For some reason, Hagrid was bent
double as though anxious not to be seen, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was still at least four feet taller than
everybody else.
<div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``can yeh come with me? Now? While evryones watchin the match?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Er... cant it wait, Hagrid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>asked Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Till the match is over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``No, Harry, its gotta be now... while evryones lookin the other way...
please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrids nose was gently dripping blood. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes were both blackened. Harry had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
this close-up since his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) return to the school; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked utterly woebegone.
<div class="bookquote">``Course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry at once, <div class="bookquote">``course well come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Hermione edged back along their row of seats, causing much grumbling among the
students who had to stand up for them. The people in Hagrids row were not complaining,
merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible.
<div class="bookquote">``I ppreciate this, you two, I really do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hag</b></font>)</div>said Hag rid as they reached the stairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kept looking
around nervously as they descended towards the lawn below. <div class="bookquote">``I jus hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) doesn notice us
goin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean Umbridge?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wont, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s got her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) whole Inquisitorial Squad sitting
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), didnt you see? She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) must be expecting trouble at the match.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, well, a bit o trouble wouldn hurt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, pausing to peer around the edge of the
stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cabin was deserted. <div class="bookquote">``Give us more
time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Hagrid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with a concerned expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face
as they hurried across the grass towards the edge of the Forest.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeh - yehll see in a mo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder as a great roar rose from the
stands behind them. <div class="bookquote">``Hey - did someone jus score?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Itll be Ravenclaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry heavily.
<div class="bookquote">``Good... good...''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid distractedly. <div class="bookquote">``Thas good...''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They had to jog to keep up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strode across the lawn, looking around with every
other step. When they reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cabin, Hermione turned automatically left towards the front
door. Hagrid, however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge
of the Forest, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized
they were no longer with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned.
<div class="bookquote">``Were goin in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shaggy head behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Into the Forest?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, perplexed.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Cmon now, quick, before were spotted!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then ducked into the cover of the trees behind Hagrid,
who was already striding away from them into the green gloom, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crossbow over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm.
Harry and Hermione ran to catch up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, why are you armed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Jus a precaution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) massive shoulders.
<div class="bookquote">``You didnt bring your crossbow the day you showed us the Thestrals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione timidly.
<div class="bookquote">``Nah, well, we weren goin in so far then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``An anyway, tha was before Firenze
left the Forest, wasn it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why does Firenze leaving make a difference?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>asked Hermione curiously.
<div class="bookquote">``Cause the other centaurs are good an riled at me, thas why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid quietly, glancing
around. <div class="bookquote">``They used ter be - well, yeh couldn call em friendly -- but we got on all righ. Kept
emselves to emselves, bu always turned up if I wanted a word. Not any more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sighed deeply.
<div class="bookquote">``Firenze said theyre angry because he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) went to work for Dumbledore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said, tripping on a
protruding root because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was busy watching Hagrids profile.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid heavily. <div class="bookquote">``Well, angry doesn cover it. Ruddy livid. If I hadn stepped in, I
reckon theydve kicked Firenze ter death -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, sounding shocked.
<div class="bookquote">``Yep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way through several low-hanging branches. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had half
the herd on to him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you stopped it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, amazed and impressed. <div class="bookquote">``By yourself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Course I did, couldnt stand by an watch em kill im, could I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Lucky I was
passin, really... an Idve thought Firenze mighta remembered tha before he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) started sendin
me stupid warnins!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added hotly and unexpectedly.
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid, scowling, did not elaborate.
<div class="bookquote">``Anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, breathing a little more heavily than -usual, <div class="bookquote">``since then the other centaursve
bin livid with me, an the trouble is theyve got a lot of influence in the Forest... cleverest
creatures in here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that why were here, Hagrid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>asked Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``The centaurs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head dismissively, <div class="bookquote">``no, its not them. Well, o course, they
could complicate the problem, yeah... but yehll see what I mean in a bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>On this incomprehensible note he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell silent and forged a little ahead, taking one stride for every
three of theirs, so that they had great trouble keeping up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they
walked further and further into the Forest that it was as dark as dusk. They were soon a long way
past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the Thestrals, but Harry felt no sense of unease
until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way in and out of trees
towards the dark heart of the Forest.
<div class="bookquote">``Hagrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, fighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way through thickly knotted brambles, over which Hagrid had
stepped with ease, and remembering very vividly what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on the other
occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had stepped off the Forest path. <div class="bookquote">``Where are we going?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bit further,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Cmon, Harry... we need ter keep together now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches and thickets of thorn through
which Hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and
Hermiones robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a
time to free themselves. Harrys arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches.
They were so deep in the Forest now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom
was a massive dark shape ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence.
The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement, even though it might
have been made by an innocent sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit. It
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never managed to get this far into the Forest without meeting some
kind of creature; their absence struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as rather ominous.
<div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, would it be all right if we lit our wands?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``Er... all righ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid whispered back. <div class="bookquote">``In fact -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right into him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and was knocked over
backwards. Harry caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) just before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hit the Forest floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe we bes jus stop fer a momen, so I can... fill yeh in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Before we ge there, like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, as Harry set her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet. They both murmured <div class="bookquote">``Lumos!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and
their wand-tips ignited. Hagrids face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering
beams and Harry saw again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked nervous and sad.
<div class="bookquote">``Righ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Well... see... the thing is...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a great breath.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, theres a good chance Im goin ter be gettin the sack any day now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``But youve lasted this long -''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione said tentatively. <div class="bookquote">``What makes you think -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Umbridge reckons it was me that put tha Niffler in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) office.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could stop himself.
<div class="bookquote">``No, it ruddy well wasn!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``Ony any-thin ter do with magical creatures an she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) thinks its got somethin ter do with me. Yeh know she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s bin lookin fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since I got back. I don wan ter go, o course, but if it wasn fer... well... the special circumstances Im abou ter explain to yeh, Id leave righ now, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s go the chance ter do it in front o the whole school, like she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) did with Trelawney.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest, but Hagrid overrode them with a wave of one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enormous hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Its not the end o the world, Ill be able ter help Dumbledore once Im outta here, I can be
useful ter the Order. An you lotll have Grubbly-Plank, yehll - yehll get through yer exams
fine...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice trembled and broke.
<div class="bookquote">``Don worry abou me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said hastily, as Hermione made to pat his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) waistcoat and mopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes with it.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, I wouldn be tellin yer this at all if I didn have ter. See, if I go... well, I can leave
withou... withou tellin someone... because Ill - Ill need yeh two ter help me. An Ron, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s willin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course well help you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry at once. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want us to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force Harry was
knocked sideways into a tree.
<div class="bookquote">``I knew yehd say yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) handkerchief, <div class="bookquote">``but I won... never... forget...
well... cmon... jus a little bit further through here... watch yerselves, now, theres nettles...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>They walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes; Harry had opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth to ask how
much further they had to go when Hagrid threw out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right arm to signal that they should stop.
<div class="bookquote">``Really easy''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``Very quiet, now...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>They crept forwards and Harry saw that they were facing a large, smooth mound of earth nearly
as tall as Hagrid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought, with a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous
animal. Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that it stood on a bare
patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or
barricade, behind which Harry, Hermione and Hagrid now stood.
<div class="bookquote">``Sleepin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>breathed Hagrid.
Sure enough, Harry could hear a distant, rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous
lungs at work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced sideways at Hermione, who was gazing at the mound with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth
slightly open. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked utterly terrified.
<div class="bookquote">``Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature, <div class="bookquote">``who is
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>Harry found this an odd question...<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>was the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been planning on asking.
<div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, you told us -''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand now shaking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``you told us none of
them wanted to come!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Harry looked from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) to Hagrid and then, as realization hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked back at the mound
with a small gasp of horror.
The great mound of earth, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Hermione and Hagrid could easily have stood, was
moving slowly up and down in time with the deep, grunting breathing. It was not a mound at all.
It was the curved back of what was clearly --
<div class="bookquote">``Well - no - he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) didn want ter come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, sounding desperate. <div class="bookquote">``But I had ter bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>),
Hermione, I had ter!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>asked Hermione, who sounded as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wanted to cry. <div class="bookquote">``Why - what -
oh, Hagrid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew if I jus got him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, sounding close to tears himself, <div class="bookquote">``an - an taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) a few manners - Id be able ter take him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) outside an show evryone he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s harmless!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harmless!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione shrilly, and Hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands as the
enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s been hurting you all
this time, hasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)? Thats why youve had all these injuries!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) don know his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own strength!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``An he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s gettin better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s not fightin so much any more --''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So, this is why it took you two months to get home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione distractedly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Hagrid,
why did you bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) didnt want to come? Wouldnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) have been happier with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
own people?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They were all bullyin him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), Hermione, cause he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s so small!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid.
<div class="bookquote">``Small?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Small?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hermione, I couldn leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, tears now trickling down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bruised face into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
beard. <div class="bookquote">``See - he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s my brother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione simply stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth open.
<div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, when you say brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry slowly, <div class="bookquote">``d o you mean --?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well - half-brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>amended Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Turns out me mother took up with another giant when

<div class="bookquote">``Yeah... well, thas what it sounds like when he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) says his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) don speak a lot of English...

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, tiny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, with a kind of hysterical sarcasm. <div class="bookquote">``Absolutely minuscule!''

hands. <div class="bookquote">``Bu - bu she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got a bit tired o him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) after a while, I must admit... so we split up on the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How on earth did you get him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) back without anyone noticing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, thas why it took so long, see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Could ony travel by nigh an through wild
country an stuff. Course, he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) covers the ground pretty well when he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) wants ter, but he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) kep

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Hagrid, why on earth didnt you let him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, flopping down on to a ripped up
tree and burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think youre going to do with a violent
giant who doesnt even want to be here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, now - violent - thas a bit harsh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, still twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands agitatedly. <div class="bookquote">``Ill admit he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) mighta taken a couple o swings at me when he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)s bin in a bad mood, but he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)s gettin better, loads better, settlin down well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are those ropes for, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest
nearby trees towards the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back to them.
<div class="bookquote">``You have to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) tied up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione faintly.
<div class="bookquote">``Well... yeah...''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, looking anxious. <div class="bookquote">``See - its like I say - he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) doesn really know is
own strength.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in
this part of the Forest.
<div class="bookquote">``So, what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked apprehensively.
<div class="bookquote">``Look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid croakily. <div class="bookquote">``After Im gone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, Harry uncomfortably aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had already
promised Hagrid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would do whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``What - what does that involve, exactly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione enquired.
<div class="bookquote">``Not food or anythin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can get his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own food, no problem. Birds an
deer an stuff... no, its company he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) needs. If I jus knew someone was carryin on tryin ter help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a bit... teachin him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), yeh know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in
front of them. Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like an oversized human, Grawp looked
strangely misshapen. What Harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great
earthen mound he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) now recognized as Grawps head. It was much larger in proportion to the body
than a human head, and was almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling, close-growing hair the color of bracken. The rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernons, directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between. The back, under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together, was very broad; and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a
little at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under the body. Harry could see
the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet, large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the
earthy Forest floor.
<div class="bookquote">``You want us to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said in a hollow voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) now understood what Firenzes
warning had meant. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) attempt is not working. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would do better to abandon it. Of course, the
other creatures who lived in the Forest would have heard Hagrids fruitless attempts to teach
Grawp English.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah - even if yeh jus talk ter him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid hopefully. <div class="bookquote">``Cause I reckon, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can talk
ter people, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)ll understand more that we all like im really, an want im ter stay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry looked at Hermione, who peered back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from between the fingers over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesnt it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) gave a very shaky
laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``Yehll do it, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caught what Harry had just said.
<div class="bookquote">``Well...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, already bound by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) promise. <div class="bookquote">``Well try, Hagrid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid said, beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) handkerchief again. <div class="bookquote">``An I don want yeh ter put yerself out too much, like... I
know yehve got exams... if yeh could jus nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a
week an have a little chat with im. Ill wake im up, then - introduce yeh -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wha-- no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, jumping up. <div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, no, dont wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), really, we dont need -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>But Hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding
towards Grawp. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was about ten feet away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lifted a long, broken bough from the
ground, smiled reassuringly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder at Harry and Hermione, then poked Grawp hard in
the middle of the back with the end of the bough.
The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent Forest; birds in the treetops overhead rose
twittering from their perches and soared away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the
gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) placed an enormous hand
upon it to push himself on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head to see who and what had disturbed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``All righ, Grawpy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, in a would-be cheery voice, backing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again. <div class="bookquote">``Had a nice sleep, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their
sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not yet uprooted. They looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It
was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball. The nose was stubby and
shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks; the eyes,
small by giant standards, were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half-gummed
together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles, each as big as a cricket ball, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, rubbed
vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet with surprising speed and agility.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh my!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawps wrists and ankles were attached
creaked ominously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was, as Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around,
Grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a birds nest from the upper
branches of a towering pine and turned it upside-down with a roar of apparent displeasure that
there was no bird in it; eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and Hagrid threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head to protect himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Anyway, Grawpy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs,
<div class="bookquote">``Ive brought some friends ter meet yeh. Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said
I might have ter go on a little trip an leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that,
Grawpy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was listening to Hagrid
or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) even recognized the sounds Hagrid was making as speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had now seized the
top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing
how far it would spring back when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) let go.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, Grawpy, don do that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>shouted Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Thas how you ended up pullin up the others -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the trees roots beginning to crack.
<div class="bookquote">``I got company for yeh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Company, see! Look down, yeh big buffoon, I
brought yeh some friends!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Hagrid, dont,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave
Grawps knee a sharp poke.
The giant let go of the top of the tree, which swayed alarmingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain
of pine needles, and looked down.
<div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood, <div class="bookquote">``is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) migh be comin ter visit yeh if I have ter go away, understand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>The giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were there. They watched, in great
trepidation, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) huge boulder of a head so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could peer blearily at them.
<div class="bookquote">``An this is Hermione, see? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)--''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid hesitated. Turning to Hermione, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Would yeh
mind if he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) called yeh Hermy, Hermione? Ony its a difficult name fer him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) ter remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>squeaked Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``This is Hermy, Grawp! An she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)s gonna be comin an all! Isn tha nice? Eh? Two friends fer
yeh ter - GRAWPY, NO!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grawp</b></font>)</div>Grawps hand had shot out of nowhere towards Hermione; Harry seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
backwards behind the tree, so that Grawps fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air.
<div class="bookquote">``BAD BOY, GRAWPY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>they heard Hagrid yelling, as Hermione clung to Harry behind the tree, shaking and whimpering. <div class="bookquote">``VERY BAD BOY! YEH DON GRAB - OUCH!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry poked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose. Grawp, apparently losing interest, had straightened up and was again engaged in
pulling back the pine as far as it would go.
<div class="bookquote">``Righ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bleeding nose and the other
grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crossbow, <div class="bookquote">``well... there yeh are... yehve met him (<font color='blue'><b>DON</b></font>) an - an now he (<font color='blue'><b>DON</b></font>)ll know yeh
when yeh come back. Yeah... well...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up at Grawp, who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached
pleasure on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) boulderish face; the roots were creaking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ripped them away from the ground.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I reckon thas enough fer one day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Well -er - well go back now, shall we?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Hermione nodded. Hagrid shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crossbow again and, still pinching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose,
led the way back into the trees.
Nobody spoke for a while, not even when they heard the distant crash that meant Grawp had
pulled over the pine tree at last. Hermiones face was pale and set. Harry could not think of a
single thing to say. What on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that Hagrid
had hidden Grawp in the Forbidden Forest? And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Ron and Hermione
would continue Hagrids totally pointless attempts to civilize the giant. How could Hagrid, even
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless, fool
himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans?
<div class="bookquote">``Hold it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were struggling through a patch of
thick knotgrass behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder and fitted it
into the crossbow. Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had stopped walking,
they, too, could hear movement close by.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, blimey''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought we told you, Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a deep male voice, <div class="bookquote">``that you are no longer welcome here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div>A mans naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating towards them through the dappled
green half-light; then they saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waist joined smoothly into a horses chestnut body. This
centaur had a proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair. Like Hagrid, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was armed; a
quiverful of arrows and a longbow were slung over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders.
<div class="bookquote">``How are yeh, Magorian?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid warily.
The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more centaurs emerged behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Harry
recognized the black-bodied and bearded Bane, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had met nearly four years ago on the
same night he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had met Firenze. Bane gave no sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ever seen Harry before.
<div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, with a nasty inflection in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice, before turning immediately to Magorian. <div class="bookquote">``We
agreed, I think, what we would do if this human ever showed his (<font color='blue'><b>DON</b></font>) face in the Forest again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''This human now, am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid testily. <div class="bookquote">``Jus  fer stoppin all of yeh committin murder?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Magorian</b></font>)</div>said Magorian. <div class="bookquote">``Our ways are not yours, nor are our
laws. Firenze has betrayed and dishonored us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dunno how yehwork that out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>DON</b></font>)s done nothin except help Albus Dumbledore -''
 (<font color='red'><b>a centaur</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Firenze has entered into servitude to humans,''  (<font color='red'><b>a centaur</b></font>)</div>said a grey centaur with a hard, deeply lined face.
<div class="bookquote">``Servitude!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid scathingly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>DON</b></font>)s doin Dumbledore a favor is all -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Magorian</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>DON</b></font>) is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Magorian</b></font>)</div>said Magorian quietly. <div class="bookquote">``There can be no return from such disgrace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If yeh say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, shrugging, <div class="bookquote">``but personally I think yehre makin a big mistake -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As are you, human,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Bane, <div class="bookquote">``coming back into our Forest when we warned you -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, yeh listen ter me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Ill have less of the our Forest, if its all the
same ter yeh. Its not up ter yeh who comes an goes in here -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Magorian</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No more is it up to you, Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Magorian</b></font>)</div>said Magorian smoothly. <div class="bookquote">``I shall let you pass today because
you are accompanied by your young --''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Theyre not his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interrupted Bane contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``Students, Magorian, from up at the school! They have probably already profited from the traitor Firenzes teachings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Magorian</b></font>)</div>said Magorian calmly, <div class="bookquote">``the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime - we do not touch the innocent. Today, Hagrid, you pass. Henceforth, stay away from this place. You forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Magorian</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won be kept outta the Fores by a bunch o old mules like yeh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid loudly.
<div class="bookquote">``Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as both Bane and the grey centaur
pawed at the ground, <div class="bookquote">``lets go, please lets go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the centaur</b></font>)</div>Hagrid moved forwards, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Magorian</b></font>) crossbow was still raised and his (<font color='blue'><b>Magorian</b></font>) eyes were still fixed
threateningly upon Magorian.
<div class="bookquote">``We know what you are keeping in the Forest, Hagrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Magorian</b></font>)</div>Magorian called after them, as the
centaurs slipped out of sight. <div class="bookquote">``And our tolerance is waning!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to Magorian.
<div class="bookquote">``Yehll tolerate im as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>)s here, its as much his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) Forest as yours!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Magorian</b></font>) yelled, as Harry
and Hermione both pushed with all their might against Hagrids moleskin waistcoat in an effort
to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moving forwards. Still scowling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked down; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) expression changed to mild
surprise at the sight of them both pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed not to have felt it.
<div class="bookquote">``Calm down, you two,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, turning to walk on while they panted along behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ruddy
old mules, though, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way
there, <div class="bookquote">``if the centaurs dont want humans in the Forest, it doesnt really look as though Harry and
I will be able -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you heard what they said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid dismissively, <div class="bookquote">``they wouldnt hurt foals - I mean,
kids. Anyway, we can let ourselves be pushed aroun by that lot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nice try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crestfallen.
At last they rejoined the path and, after another ten minutes, the trees began to thin; they were
able to see patches of clear blue sky again and, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering
and shouting.
<div class="bookquote">``Was that another goal?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch
stadium came into view. <div class="bookquote">``Or dyeh reckon the match is over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione miserably. Harry saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked much the worse for wear;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hair was full of twigs and leaves, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) robes were ripped in several places and there were
numerous scratches on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face and arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must look little better.
<div class="bookquote">``I reckon its over, yeh know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, still squinting towards the stadium. <div class="bookquote">``Look - theres
people comin out already - if yeh two hurry yehll be able ter blend in with the crowd an no
onell know yeh werent there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Well... see you later, then, Hagrid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagrid</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the moment they were out of
earshot of Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``I dont believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagrid</b></font>). I really dont believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagrid</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Calm down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Calm down!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said feverishly. <div class="bookquote">``A giant! A giant in the Forest! And were supposed to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagrid</b></font>) English lessons! Always assuming, of course, we can get past the herd of murderous
centaurs on the way in and out! I - dont -believe - him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We havent got to do anything yet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry tried to reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) in a quiet voice, as they joined a
stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading back towards the castle. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)s not asking us to do
anything unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagrid</b></font>) gets chucked out and that might not even happen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come off it, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione angrily, stopping dead in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) tracks so that the people
behind had to swerve to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s going to be chucked out and, to be perfectly
honest, after what weve just seen, who can blame Umbridge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>There was a pause in which Harry glared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes filled slowly with tears.
<div class="bookquote">``You didnt mean that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``No... well... all right... I didnt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes angrily. ``But why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) have to
make life so difficult for himself - for us?
``I dunno -''
``Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) didnt let the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King...''
``And I wish theyd stop singing that stupid song,'' said Hermione miserably, ``havent they
gloated enough?''
A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch.
``Oh, lets get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,'' said Hermione.
``Weasley can save anything, He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) never leaves a single ring, Thats why Gryffindors all sing,
Weasley is our King.''
``Hermione...'' said Harry slowly.
The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd of green-and-silver-clad
Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle, bearing a solitary
figure upon its many shoulders.
``Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) didnt let the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King...''
``No?'' said Hermione in a hushed voice.
``YES!'' said Harry loudly.
``HARRY! HERMIONE!'' yelled Ron, waving the silver Quidditch cup in the air and looking
quite beside himself. ``WE DID IT! WE WON!''
They beamed up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed. There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Rons head
got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) down. Still singing,
the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight. Harry and Hermione watched
them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of Weasley is our King died away. Then they
turned to each other, their smiles fading.
``Well save our news till tomorrow, shall we?'' said Harry.
``Yes, all right,'' said Hermione wearily. ``Im not in any hurry.''
They climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the
Forbidden Forest. Harry was not sure whether or not it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) imagination, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rather thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance, almost as
though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots.
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
O.W.L.s
Rons euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch cup was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) couldnt settle to
anything next day. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wanted to do was talk over the match, so Harry and Hermione found it
very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp. Not that either of them tried very
hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion.
As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) to join them in revising under the beech
tree at the edge of the lake, where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common
room. Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first - he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was thoroughly enjoying being
patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chair, not to mention the occasional
outbursts of Weasley is our King - but after a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) agreed that some fresh air might do him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
good.
They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time.
``Well, I mean, Id already let in that one of Daviess, so I wasnt feeling all that confident, but I
dunno, when Bradley came towards me, just out of nowhere, I thought - you can do this! And I
had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) looked like he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) was aiming
for the right goalhoop - my right, obviously, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) left - but I had a funny feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) was
feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left - his (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) right, I mean - and - well - you saw what
happened,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) concluded modestly, sweeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked
interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to them -- a
bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepuffs -- had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). ``And then, when Chambers came at
me about five minutes later - What?'' Ron asked, having stopped mid-sentence at the look on
Harrys face. ``Why are you grinning?''
``Im not,'' said Harry quickly, and looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Transfiguration notes, attempting to
straighten his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face. The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another
Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hair under this very tree. ``Im just
glad we won, thats all.''
``Yeah,'' said Ron slowly, savoring the words, ``we won. Did you see the look on Changs face
when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) nose?''
``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) cried, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)?'' said Harry bitterly.
``Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though...'' Ron frowned slightly. ``But you saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) chuck her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) broom away when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) got back to the ground, didnt you?''
``Er -'' said Harry.
``Well, actually... no, Ron,'' said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) book and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) apologetically. ``As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was
Daviess first goal.''
Rons carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment. ``You didnt watch?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said
faintly, looking from one to the other. ``You didnt see me make any of those saves?''
``Well - no,'' said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). ``But Ron, we didnt
want to leave -- we had to!''
``Yeah?'' said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. ``How come?''
``It was Hagrid,'' said Harry. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) decided to tell us why he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s been covered in injuries ever since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) got back from the giants. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wanted us to go into the Forest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), we had no choice, you
know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) gets. Anyway...''
The story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Rons indignation had been replaced by a
look of total incredulity.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) brought one back and hid it in the Forest?''
``Yep,'' said Harry grimly.
``No,'' said Ron, as though by saying this he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could make it untrue. ``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) cant have.''
``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) has,'' said Hermione firmly. ``Grawps about sixteen feet tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) snorted, ``as Hermy.''
Ron gave a nervous laugh.
``And Hagrid wants us to...?''
``Teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) English, yeah,'' said Harry.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mind,'' said Ron in an almost awed voice.
``Yes,'' said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a
series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses. ``Yes, Im starting to think
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) has. But, unfortunately, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) made Harry and me promise.''
``Well, youre just going to have to break your promise, thats all,'' said Ron firmly. ``I mean,
come on... weve got exams and were about that far -<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hand to show thumb and
forefinger almost touching '' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>- from being chucked out as it is. And anyway... remember Norbert?
Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrids monster
mates?''
``I know, its just that - we promised,'' said Hermione in a small voice.
Ron smoothed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hair flat again, looking preoccupied.
``Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sighed, ``Hagrid hasnt been sacked yet, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s hung on this long, maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)ll
hang on till the end of term and we wont have to go near Grawp at all.''
The castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted; the cloudless sky
smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake; the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a
gentle breeze. June had arrived, but to the fifth-years this meant only one thing: their OWLs were
upon them at last.
Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons were devoted to revising those
topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish
atmosphere drove nearly everything but the OWLs from Harrys mind, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did wonder
occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) must continue
giving Harry Occlumency tuition. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was quite busy and tense enough
without extra classes with Snape, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these
days to badger him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) about Occlumency; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was spending a lot of time muttering to herself, and
had not laid out any elf clothes for days.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan
had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their study habits.
``How many hours dyou think youre doing a day?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Macmillan</b></font>) demanded of Harry and Ron as they
queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes.
``I dunno,'' said Ron. ``A few.''
``More or less than eight?''
``Less, I spose,'' said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.
``Im doing eight,'' said Ernie, puffing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernie</b></font>) chest. ``Eight or nine. Im getting an hour in before
breakfast every day. Eights my average. I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a
half on Monday. Not so good on Tuesday - only seven and a quarter. Then on Wednesday -''
Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that
point, forcing Ernie to abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernie</b></font>) recital.
Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic.
``Of course, its not what you know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside
Potions a few days before the exams were to start, ``its who you know. Now, Fathers been
friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years -- old Griselda
Marchbanks - weve had her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) round for dinner and everything...''
``Do you think thats true?'' Hermione whispered in alarm to Harry and Ron.
``Nothing we can do about it if it is,'' said Ron gloomily.
``I dont think its true,'' said Neville quietly from behind them. ``Because Griselda Marchbanks is
a friend of my grans, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)s never mentioned the Malfoys.''
``Whats she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) like, Neville?'' asked Hermione at once. ``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) strict?''
``Bit like Gran, really,'' said Neville in a subdued voice.
``Knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>) wont hurt your chances, though, will it?'' Ron told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) encouragingly.
``Oh, I dont think it will make any difference,'' said Neville, still more miserably. ``Grans always
telling Professor Marchbanks Im not as good as my dad... well... you saw what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gran</b></font>)s like at St
Mungos'' Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, but didnt know what to say. It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital.
Meanwhile, a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility and
wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth- and seventh-years. Harry and Ron were much
tempted by the bottle of Baruffios Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth-year Eddie
Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine Outstanding OWLs he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) had gained
the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured
Harry he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) would reimburse him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) half the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) left Hogwarts and got a job, but before
they could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the
contents down a toilet.
``Hermione, we wanted to buy that!'' shouted Ron.
``Dont be stupid,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) snarled. ``You might as well take Harold Dingles powdered dragon claw
and have done with it.''
``Dingles got powdered dragon claw?'' said Ron eagerly.
``Not any more,'' said Hermione. ``I confiscated that, too. None of these things actually work, you
know.''
``Dragon claw does work!'' said Ron. ``Its supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a
boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours - Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it cant
hurt -''
``This stuff can,'' said Hermione grimly. ``Ive had a look at it, and its actually dried Doxy
droppings.''
This information took the edge off Harry and Rons desire for brain stimulants.
They received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for OWLs during their
next Transfiguration lesson.
``As you can see,'' Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times
of their exams from the blackboard, ``your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks. You
will sit the theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons. Your practical
Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, I must warn you that the most stringent anti-cheating charms have been applied to your

Headmistress --''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) face
that Aunt Petunia had whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt <div class="bookquote">''- has
asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely -
because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the Headmistresss new regime at
the school -''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh; Harry saw the nostrils of her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) sharp nose flare.
<div class="bookquote">''- however, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your own futures to think about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Please, Professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand in the air, <div class="bookquote">``when will we find out our results?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``An owl will be sent to you some time in July''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall.
<div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean/Dean Thomas/Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, <div class="bookquote">``so we dont have to worry about it till the holidays.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dean/Dean Thomas/Thomas</b></font>)</div>Harry imagined sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks time, waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) OWL
results. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought dully, at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be sure of one bit of post next summer.
Their first examination, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday morning. Harry agreed to
test Hermione after lunch on Sunday, but regretted it almost at once; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was very agitated and
kept snatching the book back from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to check that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had got the answer completely right,
finally hitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming.
<div class="bookquote">``Why dont you just do it yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said firmly, handing the book back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes
watering.
Meanwhile, Ron was reading two years worth of Charms notes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ears, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
lips moving soundlessly; Seamus Finnigan was lying flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnigan</b></font>) back on the floor, reciting the
definition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells,
Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practicing basic Locomotion Charms, were
making their pencil-cases race each other around the edge of the table.
Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto,
having studied hard all day. Hermione, on the other hand, kept putting down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) knife and fork
and diving under the table for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) would seize a book to check some fact or
figure. Ron was just telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) ought to eat a decent meal or she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) would not sleep that
night, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) fork slid from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) plate.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, my goodness,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said faintly, staring into the Entrance Hall. <div class="bookquote">``Is that them? Is that the
examiners?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the doors to the Great Hall they could
see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge,
Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall we go and have a closer look?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the Entrance Hall,
slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry
thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as
though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) deferentially. Professor
Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf; she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was answering Professor Umbridge very loudly
considering they were only a foot apart.
<div class="bookquote">``Journey was fine, journey was fine, weve made it plenty of times before!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Now, I havent heard from Dumbledore lately!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) added, peering around the Hall as though
hopeful he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. <div class="bookquote">``No idea where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) is, I suppose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``None at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) shoelace. <div class="bookquote">``But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) down soon enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, <div class="bookquote">``not if Dumbledore doesnt want to be found! I
should know... examined him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) did NEWTs...
did things with a wand Id never seen before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marchbanks/Griselda Marchbanks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes... well...''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron and Hermione dragged their feet up the
marble staircase as slowly as they dared, <div class="bookquote">``let me show you to the staff room. I daresay youd like a cup of tea after your journey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening. Everyone was trying to do some last-minute revising
but nobody seemed to be getting very far. Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what
felt like hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) careers consultation and McGonagalls furious declaration
that she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) would help him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) become an Auror if it was the last thing she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not the
only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally, one by one, they
fell asleep.
None of the fifth-years talked very much at breakfast next day, either: Parvati was practicing
incantations under her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) breath while the salt cellar in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) twitched; Hermione was
rereading Achievements in Charming so fast that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes appeared blurred; and Neville kept
dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.
Once breakfast was over, the fifth- and seventh-years milled around in the Entrance Hall while
the other students went off to lessons; then, at half past nine, they were called forwards class by
class to re-enter the Great Hall, which had been rearranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the
Pensieve when his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father, Sirius and Snape had been taking their OWLs; the four house tables
had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of
the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them. When they were all seated and quiet,
she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You may begin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and turned over an enormous hour-glass on the desk beside her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>), on
which there were also spare quills, ink bottles and rolls of parchment.
Harry turned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) paper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart thumping hard - three rows to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right and four seats
ahead Hermione was already scribbling - and lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes to the first question: a-RRB- Give the
incantation and b-RRB- describe the wand movement required to make objects fly.
Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick
skull of a troll... smiling slightly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bent over the paper and began to write.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, it wasnt too bad, was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>asked Hermione anxiously in the Entrance Hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper. <div class="bookquote">``Im not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of time. Did you put in the counter-charm for hiccoughs? I wasnt, sure whether I ought to, it felt like too much - and on question twenty-three -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron sternly, <div class="bookquote">``weve been through this before... were not going through every
exam afterwards, its bad enough doing them once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>The fifth-years ate lunch with the rest of the school -LRB-the four house tables had reappeared for the
lunch hour-RRB-, then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were
to wait until called for their practical examination. As small groups of students were called
forwards in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered incantations and practiced wand
movements, occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake.
Hermiones name was called. Trembling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory
Goyle and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterwards,
so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)ll be fine, remember she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron.
Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, <div class="bookquote">``Parkinson, Pansy - Patil, Padma - Patil, Parvati -
Potter, Harry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Flitwick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron quietly. Harry walked into the Great Hall, clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand so tightly
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand shook.
<div class="bookquote">``Professor Tofty is free, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>squeaked Professor Flitwick, who was standing just inside the
door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) pointed Harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was
sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor Marchbanks, who was
halfway through testing Draco Malfoy.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Tofty, consulting his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) notes and peering over his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) pince-nez at Harry
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) approached. <div class="bookquote">``The famous Potter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye, Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a scathing look over at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); the
wine-glass Malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed. Harry could not suppress a
grin; Professor Tofty smiled back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) encouragingly.
<div class="bookquote">``Thats it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quavery old voice, <div class="bookquote">``no need to be nervous. Now, if I could ask you to
take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>On the whole, Harry thought it went rather well. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Levitation Charm was certainly much better
than Malfoys had been, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had not mixed up the incantations for Color
Change and Growth Charms, so that the rat he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was supposed to be turning orange swelled
shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mistake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was glad
Hermione had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could tell Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had
no idea how it had happened.
There was no time to relax that night; they went straight to the common room after dinner and
submerged themselves in revision for Transfiguration next day; Harry went to bed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head
buzzing with complex spell models and theories.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) written paper next morning but thought
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) practical could have been a lot worse. At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) managed to Vanish the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) iguana,
whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) head completely at the next table and somehow managed
to multiply her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten
minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall.
They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday -LRB-other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium,
Harry felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done reasonably well-RRB-; and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no problem with any of the written
questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the
counter-jinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from
near the doors into the Entrance Hall.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, bravo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect Boggart banishing spell. <div class="bookquote">``Very good indeed! Well, I think thats all, Potter... unless...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leaned forwards a little.
<div class="bookquote">``I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus? For a bonus
point...?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) being sacked.
<div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) silver stag erupted from the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and cantered the length of the Hall. All of the
examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor
Tofty clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.
<div class="bookquote">``Excellent!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Very well, Potter, you may go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door, their eyes met. There was a nasty smile playing
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wide, slack mouth, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not care. Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was very much mistaken -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was not planning on telling anybody, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just achieved an Outstanding
OWL.
On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) Ancient Runes exam, and as
they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision.
They stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air was
wafting as they played wizard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on
the edge of the Forest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was trying to guess what creatures they were examining - he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought it
must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little - when the portrait hole
opened and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad-tempered.
<div class="bookquote">``How were the Runes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, yawning and stretching.
<div class="bookquote">``I mistranslated ehwaz,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione furiously. <div class="bookquote">``It means partnership, not Defense; I mixed it
up with eihwaz.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron lazily, <div class="bookquote">``thats only one mistake, isnt it, youll still get -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, shut up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Hermione angrily. <div class="bookquote">``It could be the one mistake that makes the difference
between a pass and a fail. And whats more, someones put another Niffler in Umbridges office.
I dont know how they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and Umbridge is
shrieking her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) head off - by the sound of it, it tried to take a chunk out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) leg -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry and Ron together.
<div class="bookquote">``It is not good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione hotly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) thinks its Hagrid doing it, remember? And we do not want Hagrid chucked out!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)s teaching at the moment; she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) cant blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, gesturing out of the window.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, youre so naive sometimes, Harry.You really think Umbridge will wait for proof?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said
Hermione, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) swept off towards the
girls dormitories, banging the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, very quietly, prodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) queen forward to beat
up one of Harrys knights.
Hermiones bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though Harry and Ron found it quite
easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday revising for Potions on Monday, the
exam which Harry had been looking forward to least - and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sure would be the
downfall of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ambitions to become an Auror. Sure enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found the written paper difficult,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
describe its effects accurately, having taken it illegally in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) second year.
The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had expected it to be. With Snape absent from
the proceedings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was much more relaxed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) usually was while making
potions. Neville, who was sitting very near Harry, also looked happier than Harry had ever seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) during a Potions class. When Professor Marchbanks said, <div class="bookquote">``Step away from your cauldrons,
please, the examination is over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marchbanks/Griselda Marchbanks</b></font>)</div>Harry corked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sample flask feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might not have
achieved a good grade but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had, with luck, avoided a fail.
<div class="bookquote">``Only four exams left,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil/Patil</b></font>)</div>said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed back to Gryffindor common
room.
<div class="bookquote">``Only!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione snappishly. <div class="bookquote">``Ive got Arithmancy and its probably the toughest subject
there is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div>Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was unable to vent her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) spleen on any of them
and was reduced to telling off some first-years for giggling too loudly in the common room.
Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesdays Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to
let Hagrid down. The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge
of the Forbidden Forest, where students were required to correctly identify the Knarl hidden
among a dozen hedgehogs -LRB-the trick was to offer them all milk in turn: Knarls, highly suspicious
creatures whose quills had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what they saw as
an attempt to poison them-RRB-; then demonstrate correct handling of a Bowtruckle; feed and clean
out a Fire Crab without sustaining serious burns; and choose, from a wide selection of food, the
diet they would give a sick unicorn.
Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cabin window. When Harrys examiner, a
plump little witch this time, smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a
fleeting thumbs-up before heading back to the castle.
The Astronomy theory paper on Wednesday morning went well enough. Harry was not
convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had got the names of all Jupiters moons right, but was at least confident that none
of them was inhabited by mice. They had to wait until evening for their practical Astronomy; the
afternoon was devoted instead to Divination.
Even by Harrys low standards in Divination, the exam went very badly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might as well have
tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
head completely during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as though Professor Marchbanks
would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger, and rounded off the whole fiasco by
mixing up the life and head lines on her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) palm and informing her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) ought to have died the
previous Tuesday.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, we were always going to fail that one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron gloomily as they ascended the marble
staircase. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had told the examiner
in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crystal ball, only to look up and realize
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been describing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) examiners reflection.
<div class="bookquote">``We shouldnt have taken the stupid subject in the first place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Still, at least we can give it up now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too
friendly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And from now on, I dont care if my tea-leaves spell die, Ron, die - Im just chucking them in
the bin where they belong.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stopped laughing at once, in
case it annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I think Ive done all right in Arithmancy''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, and Harry and Ron both sighed with
relief. <div class="bookquote">``Just time for a quick look over our star-charts before dinner, then...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven oclock, they found a perfect night
for stargazing, cloudless and still. The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a
slight chill in the air. Each of them set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) telescope and, when Professor Marchbanks
gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank star-chart they had been given.
Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them, watching as they entered the precise
positions of the stars and planets they were observing. All was quiet except for the rustle of
parchment, the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the scribbling
of many quills. Half an hour passed, then an hour; the little squares of reflected gold light
flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were
extinguished.
As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chart, however, the front doors of the castle
opened directly below the parapet where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was standing, so that light spilled down the stone
steps a little way across the lawn. Harry glanced down as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) made a slight adjustment to the
position of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass
before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more.
Harry put his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked down
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chart to enter the planet there, but something distracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); pausing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quill
suspended over the parchment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen
figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been
gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on
which they walked. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) recognized the walk of
the squattest of them, who seemed to be leading the group.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight, much less
accompanied by five others. Then somebody coughed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was halfway through an exam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had quite forgotten Venuss position. Jamming his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
telescope, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found it again and was once more about to enter it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chart when, alert for any
odd sound, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds, followed
immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart hammering. There were lights on in Hagrids windows and the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door closed again and
there was silence.
Harry felt very uneasy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Marchbanks</b></font>) at that moment and, not wanting to
look as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marchbanks</b></font>) was sneaking looks at anyone elses work, Harry hastily bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) starchart
and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet
towards Hagrids cabin. Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily
blocking the light.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could feel Professor Marchbankss eyes on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marchbanks</b></font>) neck and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Marchbanks</b></font>) eye again to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marchbanks</b></font>) telescope, staring up at the moon though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marchbanks</b></font>) had marked its position an hour ago, but as
Professor Marchbanks moved on he (<font color='blue'><b>Marchbanks</b></font>) heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the
darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower. Several of the people around Harry ducked
out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrids cabin.
Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough.
<div class="bookquote">``Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said softly.
Most people returned to their telescopes. Harry looked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left. Hermione was gazing
transfixed at Hagrids cabin.
<div class="bookquote">``Ahem - twenty minutes to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Tofty.
Hermione jumped and returned at once to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) star-chart; Harry looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own and
noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had mislabelled Venus as Mars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bent to correct it.
There was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people cried Ouch! when they poked
themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going
on below.
Hagrids door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quite
clearly a massive figure roaring and brandishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom,
judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) direction, seemed to be
attempting to Stun him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>cried Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``My dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Tofty in a scandalised voice. <div class="bookquote">``This is an examination!''
 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star-charts any more. Jets of red light were
still flying about beside Hagrids cabin, yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
was still upright and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed across the
grounds; a man yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Be reasonable, Hagrid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>Hagrid roared, <div class="bookquote">``Reasonable be damned, yeh won take me like this, Dawlish!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Hagrid, leaping repeatedly at the
wizards surrounding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) until a Stunning Spell caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell to the ground. Hagrid
gave a howl of fury, lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>); the man flew what
looked like ten feet and did not get up again. Hermione gasped, both hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth;
Harry looked round at Ron and saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), too, was looking scared. None of them had ever seen
Hagrid in a real temper before.
<div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil/Patil</b></font>)</div>squealed Parvati, who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle
where the front doors had opened again; more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a
single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Tofty anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``Only sixteen minutes left, you know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>But nobody paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) the slightest attention: they were watching the person now sprinting
towards the battle beside Hagrids cabin.
<div class="bookquote">``How dare you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the figure shouted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) ran. <div class="bookquote">``How dare you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Its McGonagall!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>whispered Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) alone! Alone, I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagalls voice through the darkness. <div class="bookquote">``On
what grounds are you attacking him (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) has done nothing, nothing to warrant such -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione, Parvati and Lavender all screamed. No fewer than four Stunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward Professor McGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>); for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) looked luminous, illuminated by an eerie red glow, then was lifted right off her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) feet, landed hard on her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) back, and moved no more.
<div class="bookquote">``Galloping gargoyles!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>shouted Professor Tofty, who seemed to have forgotten the exam
completely. <div class="bookquote">``Not so much as a warning! Outrageous behavior!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``COWARDS!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>bellowed Hagrid, his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) voice carring clearly to the top of the tower, and several
lights flickered back on inside the castle. <div class="bookquote">``RUDDY COWARDS! HAVE SOME O THAT - AN THAT -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh my --''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>gasped Hermione.
Hagrid took two massive swipes at his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) closest attackers; judging by their immediate collapse,
they had been knocked cold. Harry saw Hagrid double over, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had finally been
overcome by a spell. But, on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was standing again with what
appeared to be a sack on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back - then Harry realized that Fangs limp body was draped around
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) shoulders.
<div class="bookquote">``Get him (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>), get him (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>screamed Umbridge, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go
within reach of Hagrids fists; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) was backing away so fast he (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) tripped over one of his (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>)
unconscious colleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung
around his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) neck. Umbridge sent one last Stunning Spell after him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) but it missed; and Hagrid,
running full-pelt towards the distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.
There was a long minutes quivering silence as everybody gazed open-mouthed into the grounds.
Then Professor Toftys voice said feebly, <div class="bookquote">``Um... five minutes to go, everybody.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tofty</b></font>)</div>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had only filled in two-thirds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) chart, Harry was desperate for the exam to end.
When it came at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Ron and Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their
holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase. None of the students were going to bed; they
were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed.
<div class="bookquote">``That evil woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage.
<div class="bookquote">``Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawneys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Macmillan/Macmillan</b></font>)</div>said Ernie Macmillan sagely,
squeezing over to join them.
<div class="bookquote">``Hagrid did well, didnt he (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who looked more alarmed than impressed. <div class="bookquote">``How come all the spells bounced off him (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Itll be his (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) giant blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione shakily. <div class="bookquote">``Its very hard to Stun a giant, theyre like trolls,
really tough... but poor Professor McGonagall... four Stunners straight in the chest and she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)s not
exactly young, is she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dreadful, dreadful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Macmillan/Macmillan</b></font>)</div>said Ernie, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernie</b></font>) head pompously. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Im off to bed. Night, all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div>People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about what they had just seen.
<div class="bookquote">``At least they didnt get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``I spect he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)s gone to join
Dumbledore, hasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, who looked tearful. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, this is awful, I really thought
Dumbledore would be back before long, but now weve lost Hagrid too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div>They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. The commotion out in the
grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean,
who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron and Hermione, were now telling everyone what they had
seen and heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.
<div class="bookquote">``But why sack Hagrid now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Johnson/Angelina Johnson/Angelina</b></font>)</div>asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Its not like
Trelawney; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s been teaching much better than usual this year!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Umbridge hates part-humans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione bitterly, flopping down into an armchair. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
was always going to try and get Hagrid out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) thought Hagrid was putting Nifflers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) office,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katie/Katie Bell/Bell</b></font>)</div>piped up Katie Bell.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, blimey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan</b></font>)</div>said Lee Jordan, covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jordan</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``Its me whos been putting the Nifflers in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) office. Fred and George left me a couple; Ive been levitating them in through her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) window.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)d have sacked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) anyway''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean/Dean Thomas/Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Dean. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was too close to Dumbledore.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Hermiones.
<div class="bookquote">``I just hope Professor McGonagalls all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Lavender tearfully.
<div class="bookquote">``They carried her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) back up to the castle, we watched through the dormitory window,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Colin Creevey/Creevey</b></font>)</div>said Colin
Creevey <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) didnt look very well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Colin Creevey/Creevey</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Madam Pomfrey will sort her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Alicia Spinnet/Spinnet</b></font>)</div>said Alicia Spinnet firmly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)s never failed yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared. Harry felt wide awake; the
image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so angry with Umbridge
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not think of a punishment bad enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), though Rons suggestion of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had its merits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fell asleep contemplating hideous
revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.
Their final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that afternoon. Harry would very
much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been counting on the morning for a
spot of last-minute revision, so instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands by the common-room
window, trying hard not to doze off as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) read through some of the notes stacked three-and-a-half feet high that Hermione had lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
The fifth-years entered the Great Hall at two oclock and took their places in front of their facedown examination papers. Harry felt exhausted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) just wanted this to be over, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could go and sleep; then tomorrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch - he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to have a fly on Rons broom - and savor their freedom from revision.
<div class="bookquote">``Turn over your papers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the
giant hour-glass. <div class="bookquote">``You may begin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry stared fixedly at the first question. It was several seconds before it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had not taken in a word of it; there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high
windows. Slowly, tortuously, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at last began to write an answer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) simply skipped
question four -LRB-In your opinion, did wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of,
goblin riots of the eighteenth century?-RRB-, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would go back to it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had time at the
end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a stab at question five -LRB-How wasthe Statute of Secrecy breached in 1749 and what
measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence?-RRB- but had a nagging suspicion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
missed several important points; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked ahead for a question he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could definitely answer and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes alighted upon number
ten: Describe the circumstances that led to the form ation of the International Confederation of
Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join.
I know this, Harry thought, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain felt torpid and slack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could visualize a heading,
in Hermiones handwriting: The formation of the International Confederation of Wizards... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had read those notes only this morning.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hour-glass on the desk beside
Professor Marchbanks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marchbanks</b></font>) was sitting right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below
the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Patil</b></font>) chair. Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Marchbanks</b></font>) found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that
glistened in it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Patil</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Patil</b></font>) head slightly, and had to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Marchbanks</b></font>) own head a little shake to
clear it.
... the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards was Pierre
Bonaccord, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) appointment was contested by the wizarding community of Liechtenstein,
because -
All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying, burrowing rats. The sun
was very hot on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards
of Liechtenstein? Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gazed blankly at the
back of Parvatis head again. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could only perform Legilimency and open a window in the
back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre
Bonaccord and Liechtenstein...
Harry closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands, so that the glowing red of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyelids grew
dark and cool. Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll-hunting and give the trolls rights... but
Liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls... that was
it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment. Slowly,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) wrote two lines about the trolls, then read through what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) had done so far. It did not seem
very informative or detailed, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) was sure Hermiones notes on the Confederation had gone on
for pages and pages.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember... the Confederation had met
for the first time in France, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) had written that already...
Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted... he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) had written that, too...
And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come...
Think, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) told himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) hands, while all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) quills scratched out neverending answers and the sand trickled through the hour-glass at the front...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking
with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>)
destination at last... the black door swung open for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) as usual, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) was in the circular
room with its many doors...
Straight across the stone floor and through the second door... patches of dancing light on the
walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) must hurry...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the others...
Once again he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass spheres... his (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) heart was
beating very fast now... he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) was going to get there this time... when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) reached number ninety-seven he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaccord</b></font>) turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows...
But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving on the floor like a
wounded animal... Harrys stomach contracted with fear... with excitement...
A voice issued from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human kindness...
<div class="bookquote">``Take it for me... lift it down, now... I cannot touch it... but you can''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>The black shape on the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-fingered white hand clutching a
wand rise at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own arm... heard the high, cold voice say <div class="bookquote">``Crucio!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell back, writhing. Harry
was laughing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless.
<div class="bookquote">``Lord Voldemort is waiting''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Very slowly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulders a few inches and
lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face was bloodstained and gaunt, twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance...
<div class="bookquote">``Youll have to kill me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>whispered Sirius.
<div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly I shall in the end,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the cold voice. <div class="bookquote">``But you will fetch it for me first, Black...
you think you have felt pain thus far? Think again... we have hours ahead of us and nobody to
hear you scream...''
 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) wand again; somebody yelled and fell
sideways off a hot desk on to the cold stone floor; Harry awoke as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hit the ground, still yelling,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar on fire, as the Great Hall erupted all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
Out of the Fire
<div class="bookquote">``Im not going... I dont need the hospital wing... I dont want''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was gibbering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to pull away from Professor Tofty, who was looking at Harry with
much concern after helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out into the Entrance Hall with the students all around them
staring.
<div class="bookquote">``Im - Im fine, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry stammered, wiping the sweat from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Really... I just fell
asleep... had a nightmare...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pressure of examinations!''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>said the old wizard sympathetically, patting Harry shakily on the
shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``It happens, young man, it happens! Now, a cooling drink of water, and perhaps you
will be ready to return to the Great Hall? The examination is nearly over, but you may be able to
round off your last answer nicely?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry wildly. <div class="bookquote">``I mean... no... Ive done - done as much as I can, I think...''
 (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>said the old wizard gently. <div class="bookquote">``I shall go and collect your examination paper
and I suggest that you go and have a nice lie down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ill do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, nodding vigorously. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks very much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>The second that the old mans heels disappeared over the threshold into the Great Hall, Harry ran
up the marble staircase, hurtled along the corridors so fast the portraits he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed muttered
reproaches, up more flights of stairs, and finally burst like a hurricane through the double doors
of the hospital wing, causing Madam Pomfrey - who had been spooning some bright blue liquid
into Montagues open mouth - to shriek in alarm.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter, what do you think youre doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I need to see Professor McGonagall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>gasped Harry, the breath tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lungs. <div class="bookquote">``Now... its
urgent!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)s not here, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div>said Madam Pomfrey sadly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) was transferred to St. Mungos this
morning. Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) age? Its a wonder they didnt kill her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)s... gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, shocked.
The bell rang just outside the dormitory and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard the usual distant rumbling of students
starting to flood out into the corridors above and below him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remained quite still, looking at
Madam Pomfrey. Terror was rising inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
There was nobody left to tell. Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had gone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had always
expected Professor McGonagall to be there, irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always
dependably, solidly present...
<div class="bookquote">``I dont wonder youre shocked, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>McGonagall/Minerva/Minerva McGonagall</b></font>)</div>said Madam Pomfrey, with a kind of fierce approval in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``As if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face-on by daylight!
Cowardice, thats what it was... despicable cowardice... if I wasnt worried what would happen
to you students without me, Id resign in protest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry blankly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wheeled around and strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
stood, buffeted by the crowd, panic expanding inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) like poison gas so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head swam
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not think what to do...
Ron and Hermione, said a voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was running again, pushing students out of the way, oblivious to their angry protests. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
sprinted back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) saw them
hurrying towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione at once, looking very frightened. <div class="bookquote">``What happened? Are you all right?
Are you ill?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where have you been?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>demanded Ron.
<div class="bookquote">``Come with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, Ive got to tell you something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) led them along the first-floor corridor, peering through doorways, and at last found an empty
classroom into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dived, closing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they
were inside, and leaned against it, facing them.
<div class="bookquote">``Voldemorts got Sirius.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How dyou -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Saw it. Just now. When I fell asleep in the exam.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But - but where? How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, whose face was white.
<div class="bookquote">``I dunno how,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``But I know exactly where. Theres a room in the Department of
Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls and theyre at the end of row ninety-seven... he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) wants from in there... he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s torturing him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)... says he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)ll end by killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry found his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice was shaking, as were his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moved over to a desk and sat down on
it, trying to master himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Howre we going to get there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked them.
There was a moments silence. Then Ron said, <div class="bookquote">``G-get there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said loudly.
<div class="bookquote">``But - Harry...''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron weakly.
<div class="bookquote">``What? What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not understand why they were both gaping at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was asking them
something unreasonable.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a rather frightened voice, <div class="bookquote">``er... how... how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do I know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>bellowed Harry. <div class="bookquote">``The question is how were going to get in there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But... Harry, think about this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, taking a step towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``its five oclock in
the afternoon... the Ministry of Magic must be full of workers... how would Voldemort and
Sirius have got in without being seen? Harry... theyre probably the two most wanted wizards in
the world... you think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dunno, Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Anyway, the
Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever Ive been -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Youve never been there, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Youve dreamed about the place,
thats all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Theyre not normal dreams!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry shouted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face, standing up and taking a step closer to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) in turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How dyou explain Rons dad then, what was all that about,
how come I knew what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s got a point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``But this is just -- just sounds unlikely.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione desperately. <div class="bookquote">``Harry, how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s been in Grimmauld Place all the time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sirius mightve cracked and just wanted some fresh air,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, sounding worried. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s
been desperate to get out of that house for ages -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione persisted, <div class="bookquote">``why on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the
weapon, or whatever the thing is?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dunno, there could be loads of reasons!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Maybe Sirius is just someone
Voldemort doesnt care about seeing hurt -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know what, Ive just thought of something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron in a hushed voice. <div class="bookquote">``Siriuss brother
was a Death Eater, wasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)? Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah - and thats why Dumbledores been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said
Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, Im sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>cried Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``but neither of you is making sense, and weve got no proof
for any of this, no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hermione, Harrys seen them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Ron, rounding on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, looking frightened yet determined, <div class="bookquote">``Ive just got to say this -''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You... this isnt a criticism, Harry! But you do... sort of... I mean - dont you think youve got
a bit of a - a -saving-people thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``And whats that supposed to mean, a -saving-people thing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well... you...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked more apprehensive than ever. <div class="bookquote">``I mean... last year, for instance... in
the lake... during the Tournament... you shouldnt have... I mean, you didnt need to save that
little Delacour girl... you got a bit... carried away...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A wave of hot, prickly anger swept through Harrys body; how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) of that
blunder now?
<div class="bookquote">``I mean, it was really great of you and everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quickly, looking positively
petrified at the look on Harrys face, <div class="bookquote">``everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Harry through gritted teeth, <div class="bookquote">``because I definitely remember Ron saying Id
wasted time acting the hero... is that what you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero
again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking aghast. <div class="bookquote">``Thats not what I mean at all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, spit out what youve got to say, because were wasting time here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry shouted.
<div class="bookquote">``Im trying to say - Voldemort knows you, Harry! He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took Ginny down into the Chamber of
Secrets to lure you there, its the kind of thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) does, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knows youre the - the sort of person
whod go to Siriuss aid! What if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s just trying to get you into the Department of Myst--?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hermione, it doesnt matter if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s done it to get me there or not - theyve taken McGonagall to
St. Mungos, there isnt anyone from the Order left at Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we dont
go, Sirius is dead!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Harry - what if your dream was - was just that, a dream?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry let out a roar of frustration. Hermione actually stepped back from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), looking alarmed.
<div class="bookquote">``You dont get it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry shouted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Im not having nightmares, Im not just dreaming!
What dyou think all the Occlumency was for, why dyou think Dumbledore wanted me
prevented from seeing these things? Because theyre REAL, Hermione - Sirius is trapped, Ive
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>). Voldemorts got him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>), and no one else knows, and that means were the only ones who
can save him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>), and if you dont want to do it, fine, but Im going, understand? And if I remember
rightly, you didnt have a problem with my saving-people thing when it was you I was saving
from the Dementors, or -''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rounded on Ron <div class="bookquote">''- when it was your sister I was saving from the
Basilisk -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never said I had a problem!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron heatedly.
<div class="bookquote">``But Harry, youve just said it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione fiercely, <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if youd done Occlumency properly youd never have seen this -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``IF YOU THINK IM JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVENT SEEN -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``WELL, I EXPECT HE (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF HE (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) KNEW WHAT ID JUST-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>The classroom door opened. Harry, Ron and Hermione whipped around. Ginny walked in,
looking curious, closely followed by Luna, who as usual looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) had drifted in
accidentally.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny uncertainly. <div class="bookquote">``We recognized Harrys voice. What are you yelling about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry roughly.
Ginny raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) eyebrows.
<div class="bookquote">``Theres no need to take that tone with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) said coolly, <div class="bookquote">``I was only wondering whether I
could help.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you cant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry shortly.
<div class="bookquote">``Youre being rather rude, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>said Luna serenely.
Harry swore and turned away. The very last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted now was a conversation with Luna
Lovegood.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Wait... Harry, they can help.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry and Ron looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said urgently, <div class="bookquote">``Harry, we need to establish whether Sirius really has left
Headquarters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ive told you, I saw -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry, Im begging you, please!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione desperately. <div class="bookquote">``Please lets just check that Sirius
isnt at home before we go charging off to London. If we find out he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s not there, then I swear I
wont try to stop you. Ill come, Ill d - do whatever it takes to try and save him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sirius is being tortured NOW!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>shouted Harry. <div class="bookquote">``We havent got time to waste.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But if this is a trick of Voldemorts, Harry, weve got to check, weve got to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Howre we going to check?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well have to use Umbridges fire and see if we can contact him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, who looked
positively terrified at the thought. <div class="bookquote">``Well draw Umbridge away again, but well need lookouts,
and thats where we can use Ginny and Luna.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny said immediately, <div class="bookquote">``Yeah,
well do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>and Luna said, <div class="bookquote">``When you say Sirius, are you talking about Stubby Boardman?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>Nobody answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said aggressively to Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``Okay, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, Im with you, otherwise Im going to the Department of Mysteries right now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Department of Mysteries?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>said Luna, looking mildly surprised. <div class="bookquote">``But how are you going to
get there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Again, Harry ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands together and pacing up and down between the desks.
<div class="bookquote">``Right... well... one of us has to go and find Umbridge and - and send her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) off in the wrong
direction, keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) office. They could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) - I dont know - that Peeves is up to
something awful as usual''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ill do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron at once. <div class="bookquote">``Ill tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department
or something, its miles away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) office. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade
Peeves to do it if I met him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) on the way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the
smashing up of the Transfiguration department.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) brow furrowed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) continued to pace. <div class="bookquote">``Now, we need to keep students
right away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) office while we force entry, or some Slytherins bound to go and tip her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny promptly, <div class="bookquote">``and warn people not to go down there because someones let off a load of Garrotting Gas.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie; Ginny shrugged and said, <div class="bookquote">``Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Well then, Harry, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak and well sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s not there, Hermione!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean, you can - can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I dont think
you should be in there alone, Lees already proved the windows a weak spot, sending those
Nifflers through it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Even through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) anger and impatience, Harry recognized Hermiones offer to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
into Umbridges office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty.
<div class="bookquote">``I... okay, thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttered.
<div class="bookquote">``Right, well, even if we do all of that, I dont think were going to be able to bank on more than
five minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, <div class="bookquote">``not
with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Five minutesll be enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Cmon, lets go -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking shocked.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry angrily. <div class="bookquote">``What did you think, were going to wait until after dinner
or something? Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I - oh, all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said desperately. <div class="bookquote">``You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and well meet you
at the end of Umbridges corridor, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry didnt answer, but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way through the
milling crowds outside. Two floors up he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jovially and
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) they were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the common room.
Harry barely heard them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing
about how many black-market Butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the
Invisibility Cloak and Siriuss knife secure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) bag, before they noticed he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had left them.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, dyou want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle reckons he (<font color='blue'><b>Dingle</b></font>) could sell us some
Firewhisky -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a couple of minutes later was
jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna, who were huddled together
at the end of Umbridges corridor.
<div class="bookquote">``Got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) panted. <div class="bookquote">``Ready to go, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth-years passed them. <div class="bookquote">``So Ron - you go and head Umbridge off... Ginny, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor... Harry and I will get the Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Ron strode away, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bright-red hair visible right to the end of the passage; meanwhile Ginnys
equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction,
trailed by Lunas blonde one.
<div class="bookquote">``Get over here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>muttered Hermione, tugging at Harrys wrist and pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back into a recess
where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column. <div class="bookquote">``Are - are
you sure youre okay, Harry? Youre still very pale.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Im fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said shortly, tugging the Invisibil i ty Cloak from out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag. In truth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar
was aching, but not so badly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow; it had
hurt much worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery...
<div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Avery</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and they stood listening
carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them.
<div class="bookquote">``You cant come down here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>Ginny was calling to the crowd. <div class="bookquote">``No, sorry, youre going to have
to go round by the swivelling staircase, someones let off Garrotting Gas just along here -''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>They could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, <div class="bookquote">``I cant see no gas.''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats because its colorless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice, <div class="bookquote">``but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then well have your body as proof for the next idiot who doesnt believe us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>Slowly, the crowd thinned. The news about the Garrotting Gas seemed to have spread; people
were not coming this way any more. When at last the surrounding area was quite clear,
Hermione said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``I think thats as good as were going to get, Harry -- come on, lets do
it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>They moved forwards, covered by the Cloak. Luna was standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) back to them at the far
end of the corridor. As they passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Good one... dont forget the
signal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whats the signal?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>muttered Harry, as they approached Umbridges door.
<div class="bookquote">``A loud chorus of Weasly is our King if they see Umbridge coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Siriuss knife in the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open and they entered the office.
The garish kittens were basking in the late-afternoon sunshine that was warming their plates, but
otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) might have added extra security after the second Niffler.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They pulled off the Cloak; Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering
down into the grounds with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand out. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of
Floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into life there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
knelt down quickly, thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head into the dancing fire and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Number twelve, Grimmauld
Place!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head began to spin as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just got off a fair-ground ride though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees remained
firmly planted on the cold office floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and
when the spinning stopped he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened them to find himself looking out at the long, cold kitchen
of Grimmauld Place.
There was nobody there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had expected this, yet was not prepared for the molten wave of
dread and panic that seemed to burst through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach at the sight of the deserted room.
<div class="bookquote">``Sirius?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Sirius, are you there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the
right of the fire.
<div class="bookquote">``Whos there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) called, wondering whether it was just a mouse.
Kreacher the house-elf crept into view. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked highly delighted about something, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged.
<div class="bookquote">``Its the Potter boys head in the fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Kreacher informed the empty kitchen, stealing furtive,
oddly triumphant glances at Harry. <div class="bookquote">``What has he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) come for, Kreacher wonders?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wheres Sirius, Kreacher?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry demanded.
The house-elf gave a wheezy chuckle.
<div class="bookquote">``Master has gone out, Harry Potter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wheres he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) gone? Wheres he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) gone, Kreacher?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kreacher</b></font>)</div>Kreacher merely cackled.
<div class="bookquote">``Im warning you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, fully aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scope for inflicting punishment upon
Kreacher was almost non-existent in this position. <div class="bookquote">``What about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any of them,
are any of them there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nobody here but Kreacher!''  (<font color='red'><b>the elf</b></font>)</div>said the elf gleefully, and turning away from Harry he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) began to
walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen. <div class="bookquote">``Kreacher thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Mad-Eye</b></font>) will have a little chat
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mad-Eye</b></font>) mistress now, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mad-Eye</b></font>) hasnt had a chance in a long time, Kreachers master has been
keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where has Sirius gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled after the elf. <div class="bookquote">``Kreacher, has he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gone to the Department of
Mysteries?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kreacher</b></font>)</div>Kreacher stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tracks. Harry could just make out the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bald head through the
forest of chair legs before him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) is going,''  (<font color='red'><b>the elf</b></font>)</div>said the elf quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``But you know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>shouted Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Dont you? You know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the elf</b></font>)</div>There was a moments silence, then the elf let out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loudest cackle yet.
<div class="bookquote">``Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said gleefully. <div class="bookquote">``Kreacher and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) mistress are alone again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scurried forwards and disappeared through the door to the hall.
<div class="bookquote">``You -!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could utter a single curse or insult, Harry felt a great pain at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
inhaled a lot of ash and, choking, found himself being dragged backwards through the flames,
until with a horrible abruptness he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was staring up into the wide, pallid face of Professor
Umbridge who had dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) backwards out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
neck back as far as it would go, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) were going to slit his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) throat.
<div class="bookquote">``You think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) whispered, bending Harrys neck back even further, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was looking up at the ceiling, <div class="bookquote">``that after two Nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature
enter my office without my knowledge? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my
doorway after the last one got in, you foolish boy. Take his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) barked at someone he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could not see, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes and remove the wand.
<div class="bookquote">``Hers, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had also just had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand
wrested from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I want to know why you are in my office,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, shaking the fist clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) staggered.
<div class="bookquote">``I was - trying to get my Firebolt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry croaked.
<div class="bookquote">``Liar.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head again. <div class="bookquote">``Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons, as you
very well know, Potter. You had your head in my fire. With whom have you been
communicating?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No one -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, trying to pull away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt several hairs part company with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
scalp.
<div class="bookquote">``Liar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>shouted Umbridge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slammed into the desk. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode. Malfoy was leaning on the
windowsill, smirking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) threw Harrys wand into the air one-handed and caught it again.
There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered, each gripping Ron, Ginny,
Luna and - to Harrys bewilderment - Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and
looked in imminent danger of suffocation. All four of them had been gagged.
<div class="bookquote">``Got em all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Warrington</b></font>)</div>said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forwards into the room. <div class="bookquote">``That one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
poked a thick finger at Neville, <div class="bookquote">``tried to stop me taking her (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``so I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) along too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good, good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Umbridge/Dolores Umbridge/Dolores</b></font>)</div>said Umbridge, watching Ginnys struggles. <div class="bookquote">``Well, it looks as though Hogwarts
will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, doesnt it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically. Umbridge gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wide, complacent smile and
settled herself into a chintz-covered armchair, blinking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) captives like a toad in a
flowerbed.
<div class="bookquote">``So, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
nodded at Ron -- Malfoy laughed even louder - ``to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes - Mr. Filch having just informed me so.
``Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it Albus Dumbledore? Or the
half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) is still too ill to talk to
anyone.''
Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that. Harry found he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so full of rage and hatred he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was shaking.
``Its none of your business who I talk to,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) snarled.
Umbridges slack face seemed to tighten.
``Very well,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) most dangerous and falsely sweet voice. ``Very well, Mr Potter... I
offered you the chance to tell me freely. You refused. I have no alternative but to force you.
Draco fetch Professor Snape.''
Malfoy stowed Harrys wand inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) robes and left the room smirking, but Harry hardly
noticed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just realized something; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been so stupid as to forget
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could help him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) save Sirius,
were gone - but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been wrong. There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at
Hogwarts - Snape.
There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resulting from the
Slytherins efforts to keep Ron and the others under control. Rons lip was bleeding on to
Umbridges carpet as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) struggled against Warringtons half-nelson; Ginny was still trying to
stamp on the feet of the sixth-year girl who had both her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) upper arms in a tight grip; Neville was
turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at Crabbes arms; and Hermione was
attempting, in vain, to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). Luna, however, stood limply by the side
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) captor, gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings.
Harry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face deliberately
smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy entered the
room, closely followed by Snape.
``You wanted to see me, Headmistress?'' said Snape, looking around at all the pairs of struggling
students with an expression of complete indifference.
``Ah, Professor Snape,'' said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing up again. ``Yes, I would like
another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as you can, please.''
``You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) said, surveying her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) coolly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) greasy
curtains of black hair. ``Surely you did not use it all? I told you that three drops would be
sufficient.''
Umbridge flushed.
``You can make some more, cant you?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it
always did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was furious.
``Certainly,'' said Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) lip curling. ``It takes a full moon-cycle to mature, so I should have it
ready for you in around a month.''
``A month?'' squawked Umbridge, swelling toadishly. ``A month? But I need it this evening,
Snape! I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons
unknown!''
``Really?'' said Snape, showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) first, faint sign of interest as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) looked round at Harry. ``Well,
it doesnt surprise me. Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cold, dark eyes were boring into Harrys, who met his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gaze unflinchingly, concentrating hard
on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dream, willing Snape to read it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) mind, to understand...
``I wish to interrogate him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)!'' repeated Umbridge angrily, and Snape looked away from Harry back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) furiously quivering face. ``I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) to tell me the truth!''
``I have already told you,'' said Snape smoothly, ``that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum.
Unless you wish to poison Potter - and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you
if you did - I cannot help you. The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim
much time for truth-telling.''
Snape looked back at Harry, who stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), frantic to communicate without words.
Voldemorts got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) thought desperately.Voldemorts
got Sirius -
``You are on probation!'' shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape looked back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
eyebrows slightly raised. ``You are being deliberately unhelpful! I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you! Now get out of my office!''
Snape gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) an ironic bow and turned to leave. Harry knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) last chance of letting the
Order know what was going on was walking out of the door.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)s got Padfoot!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)s got Padfoot at the place where its hidden!''
Snape had stopped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hand on Umbridges door handle.
``Padfoot?'' cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry to Snape. ``What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden? What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) mean, Snape?''
Snape looked round at Harry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) face was inscrutable. Harry could not tell whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
understood or not, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge.
``I have no idea,'' said Snape coldly. ``Potter, when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe, loosen your hold a little. If Longbottom suffocates it will
mean a lot of tedious paperwork and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if
ever you apply for a job.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) with a snap, leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before:
Snape had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) very last hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same
way; her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) chest was heaving with rage and frustration.
``Very well,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) pulled out her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand. ``Very well...I am left with no alternative...
this is more than a matter of school discipline...this is an issue of Ministry security...yes...yes...''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) seemed to be talking herself into something. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was shifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) weight nervously from
foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand against her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) empty palm and breathing heavily. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), Harry felt horribly powerless without his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own wand.
``You are forcing me, Potter... I do not want to,'' said Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the
spot, ``but sometimes circumstances justify the use... I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice.''
Malfoy was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) with a hungry expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) face.
``The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,'' said Umbridge quietly.
``No!'' shrieked Hermione. ``Professor Umbridge - its illegal.''
But Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty, eager, excited look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) face that Harry had
never seen before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand.
``The Minister wouldnt want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge!'' cried Hermione.
``What Cornelius doesnt know wont hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>),'' said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) pointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand at different parts of Harrys body in turn, apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>) never knew I ordered Dementors to go after Potter last summer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) was delighted to be given the chance to expel him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>), all the same.''
``It was you!'' gasped Harry. ``You sent the Dementors after me?''
``Somebody had to act,'' breathed Umbridge, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand came to rest pointing directly at Harrys
forehead. ``They were all bleating about silencing you somehow - discrediting you - but I was the one who actually did something about it... only you wriggled out of that one, didnt you, Potter? Not today though, not now -'' And taking a deep breath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) cried, ``Cruc--''
``NO!'' shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode. ``No - Harry - well have to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)!''
``No way!'' yelled Harry, staring at the little of Hermione he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see.
``Well have to, Harry, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)ll force it out of you anyway, whats... whats the point?''
And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrodes robes. Millicent
stopped trying to squash her (<font color='blue'><b>Millicent</b></font>) against the wall immediately and dodged out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Millicent</b></font>) way looking
disgusted.
``Well, well, well!'' said Umbridge, looking triumphant. ``Little Miss Question-all is going to give
us some answers! Come on then, girl, come on!''
``Er - my - nee - no!'' shouted Ron through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) gag.
Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) before. Neville, still choking
for breath, was gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), too. But Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was
sobbing desperately into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands, there was no trace of a tear.
``Im - Im sorry everyone,'' said Hermione. ``But - I cant stand it -''
``Thats right, thats right, girl!'' said Umbridge, seizing Hermione by the shoulders, thrusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>). ``Now then... with whom was Potter
communicating just now?''
``Well,'' gulped Hermione into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands, ``well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore.''
Ron froze, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes wide; Ginny stopped trying to stamp on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) Slytherin captors toes; and even
Luna looked mildly surprised. Fortunately, the attention of Umbridge and her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) minions was
focused too exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs.
``Dumbledore?'' said Umbridge eagerly. ``You know where Dumbledore is, then?''
``Well... no'' sobbed Hermione. ``Weve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three
Broomsticks and even the Hogs Head -''
``Idiot girl - Dumbledore wont be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministrys looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)!''
shouted Umbridge, disappointment etched in every sagging line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face.
``But - but we needed to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) something important!'' wailed Hermione, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands
more tightly over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face, not, Harry knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued
absence of tears.
``Yes?'' said Umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement. ``What was it you wanted to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)?''
``We... we wanted to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) its r - ready!'' choked H ermione.
``Whats ready?'' demanded Umbridge, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) grabbed Hermiones shoulders again and
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) slightly. ``Whats ready, girl?''
``The... the weapon,'' said Hermione.
``Weapon? Weapon?'' said Umbridge, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes seemed to pop with excitement. ``You have
been developing some method of resistance? A weapon you could use against the Ministry? On
Professor Dumbledores orders, of course?''
``Y -- y - yes,'' gasped Hermione, ``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had to leave before it was finished and n - n - now
weve finished it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), and we c - c - cant find him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) t - t - to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)!''
``What kind of weapon is it?'' said Umbridge harshly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) stubby hands still tight on Hermiones
shoulders.
``We dont r - r - really understand it,'' said Hermione, sniffing loudly. ``We j - j - just did what P - P - Professor Dumbledore told us t - t - to do.''
Umbridge straightened up, looking exultant.
``Lead me to the weapon,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) said.
``Im not showing... them,'' said Hermione shrilly, looking around at the Slytherins through her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
fingers.
``It is not for you to set conditions,'' said Professor Umbridge harshly.
``Fine,'' said Hermione, now sobbing into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands again. ``Fine... let them see it, I hope they use it on you! In fact, I wish youd invite loads and loads of people to come and see! Th - that would serve you right - oh, Id love it if the wh - whole school knew where it was, and how to u - use it, and then if you annoy any of them theyll be able to s - sort you out!''
These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) Inquisitorial Squad, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to
disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) face.
Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment, then spoke in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) clearly
thought was a motherly voice.
``All right, dear, lets make it just you and me... and well take Potter, too, shall we? Get up,
now.''
``Professor,'' said Malfoy eagerly, ``Professor Umbridge, I think some of the Squad should come
with you to look after -''
``I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two
wandless teenagers alone?'' asked Umbridge sharply. ``In any case, it does not sound as though
this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until I return and
make sure none of these -<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) gestured around at Ron, Ginny, Neville and Luna '' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>- escape.''
``All right,'' said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed.
``And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way'' said Umbridge, pointing at Harry and
Hermione with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand. ``Lead on.''
CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
Fight and Flight
Harry had no idea what Hermione was planning, or even whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had a plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked half
a pace behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) as they headed down the corridor outside Umbridges office, knowing it would
look very suspicious if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) appeared not to know where they were going. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not dare attempt
to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>); Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) ragged
breathing.
Hermione led the way down the stairs into the Entrance Hall. The din of loud voices and the
clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall - it seemed
incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the
end of exams, not a care in the world...
Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy
evening air. The sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now, and as
Hermione marched purposefully across the grass - Umbridge jogging to keep up - their long dark
shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks.
``Its hidden in Hagrids hut, is it?'' said Umbridge eagerly in Harrys ear.
``Of course not,'' said Hermione scathingly. ``Hagrid might have set it off accidentally''
``Yes,'' said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting. ``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) would have done, of
course, the great half-breed oaf.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) by the throat, but resisted. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew it
would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill.
``Then... where is it?'' asked Umbridge, with a hint of uncertainty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) voice as Hermione
continued to stride towards the Forest.
``In there, of course,'' said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees. ``It had to be somewhere that
students werent going to find it accidentally, didnt it?''
``Of course,'' said Umbridge, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) sounded a little apprehensive now. ``Of course... very
well, then... you two stay ahead of me.''
``Can we have your wand, then, if were going first?'' Harry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
``No, I dont think so, Mr. Potter,'' said Umbridge sweetly, poking him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the back with it. ``The
Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours, Im afraid.''
As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch Hermiones eye; walking
into the Forest without wands seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to be more foolhardy than anything they had done
so far this evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged
straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that Umbridge, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) shorter legs, had difficulty
in keeping up.
``Is it very far in?'' Umbridge asked, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) robe ripped on a bramble.
``Oh yes,'' said Hermione, ``yes, its well hidden.''
Harrys misgivings increased. Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit
Grawp, but the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. Hermione had
not been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on that occasion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doubted she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had any idea what danger lay at the end of it.
``Er - are you sure this is the right way?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pointedly.
``Oh yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said in a steely voice, crashing through the undergrowth with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought was
a wholly unnecessary amount of noise. Behind them, Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling.
Neither of them paused to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) up again; Hermione merely strode on, calling loudly over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
shoulder, ``Its a bit further in!''
``Hermione, keep your voice down,'' Harry muttered, hurrying to catch up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). ``Anything
could be listening in here -''
``I want us heard,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) answered quietly, as Umbridge jogged noisily after them. ``Youll see...''
They walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once again so deep into the Forest
that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light. Harry had the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had had before in the
Forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes.
``How much further?'' demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Not far now!'' shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim, dank clearing. ``Just a little bit -''
An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves; Harry could feel the Forest floor trembling;
Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) like a shield -
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrenched himself free of her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) and turned. Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side,
their bows raised and loaded, pointing at Harry Hermione and Umbridge. They backed slowly
into the center of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror. Harry looked
sideways at Hermione. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was wearing a triumphant smile.
``Who are you?'' said a voice.
Harry looked left. The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian was walking towards them out
of the circle: his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bow, like those of the others, was raised. On Harrys right, Umbridge was still
whimpering, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand trembling violently as she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) pointed it at the advancing centaur.
``I asked you who are you, human,'' said Magorian rou ghly.
``I am Dolores Umbridge!'' said Umbridge in a high-p i tched, terrified voice. ``Senior
Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts!''
``You are from the Ministry of Magic?'' said Magorian, as many of the centaurs in the
surrounding circle shifted restlessly.
``Thats right!'' said Umbridge, in an even higher voice, ``so be very careful! By the laws laid
down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by
half-breeds such as yourselves on a human -''
``What did you call us?'' shouted a wild-looking black centaur, whom Harry recognized as Bane.
There was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them.
``Dont call them that!'' Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did not appear to have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>).
Still pointing her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) shaking wand at Magorian, she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) continued, ``Law Fifteen B states clearly that
any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore
considered responsible for its actions --<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>a creature</b></font>)</div>Near-human intelligence?'' repeated Magorian, as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground. ``We consider that a great insult, human! Our intelligence, thankfully, far
outstrips your own.''
``What are you doing in our Forest?'' bellowed the hard-faced grey centaur Harry and Hermione
had seen on their last trip into the Forest. ``Why are you here?''
``Your Forest?'' said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but also, it seemed, with
indignation. ``I would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits
you certain areas of land -''
An arrow flew so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) head that it caught at her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) mousy hair in passing: she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) let out an earsplitting scream and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) head, while some of the centaurs bellowed their
approval and others laughed raucously. The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing
around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving.
``Whose Forest is it now, human?'' bellowed Bane.
``Filthy half-breeds!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) screamed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hands still tight over her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) head. ``Beasts! Uncontrolled
animals!''
``Be quiet!'' shouted Hermione, but it was too late: Umbridge pointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand at Magorian and
screamed, ``Incarcerous!''
Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves tightly around the centaurs
torso and trapping his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arms: he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gave a cry of rage and reared on to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hind legs, attempting to
free himself, while the other centaurs charged.
Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) to the ground; face down on the Forest floor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew a
moment of terror as hooves thundered around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but the centaurs leapt over and around them,
bellowing and screaming with rage.
``Nooooo!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Umbridge shriek. ``Noooooo... I am Senior Undersecretary... you cannot -
Unhand me, you animals... nooooo!''
Harry saw a flash of red light and knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had attempted to Stun one of them; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>)
screamed very loudly. Lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head a few inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized
from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) wand fell
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) hand to the ground, and Harrys heart leapt. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could just reach it -
But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stretched out a hand towards it, a centaurs hoof descended upon the wand and it broke
cleanly in half.
``Now!'' roared a voice in Harrys ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) upright. Hermione, too, had been pulled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet. Over the plunging, many-colored backs
and heads of the centaurs, Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane.
Screaming non-stop, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the
trampling of hooves surrounding them.
``And these?'' said the hard-faced, grey centaur holding Hermione.
``They are young,'' said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry. ``We do not attack foals.''
``They brought her (<font color='blue'><b>half-breeds</b></font>) here, Ronan,'' replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on Harry. ``And
they are not so young... he (<font color='blue'><b>Ronan</b></font>) is nearing manhood, this one.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shook Harry by the neck of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes.
``Please,'' said Hermione breathlessly, ``please, dont attack us, we dont think like her (<font color='blue'><b>half-breeds</b></font>), we arent
Ministry of Magic employees! We only came in here because we hoped youd drive her (<font color='blue'><b>half-breeds</b></font>) off for
us.''
Harry knew at once, from the look on the face of the grey centaur holding Hermione, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
had made a terrible mistake in saying this. The grey centaur threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back legs
stamping furiously, and bellowed, ``You see, Ronan? They already have the arrogance of their
kind! So we were to do your dirty work, were we, human girl? We were to act as your servants,
drive away your enemies like obedient hounds?''
``No!'' said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak. ``Please - I didnt mean that! I just hoped youd be able to - to help us -''
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) seemed to be going from bad to worse.
``We do not help humans!'' snarled the centaur holding Harry, tightening his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grip and rearing a
little at the same time, so that Harrys feet left the ground momentarily. ``We are a race apart and
proud to be so. We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that we did your bidding!''
``Were not going to say anything like that!'' Harry shouted. ``We know you didnt do what you
did because we wanted you to -''
But nobody seemed to be listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
A bearded centaur towards the back of the crowd shouted, ``They came here unasked, they must
pay the consequences!''
A roar of approval met these words and a dun-colored centaur shouted, ``They can join the
woman!''
``You said you didnt hurt the innocent!'' shouted Hermione, real tears sliding down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face now. ``We havent done anything to hurt you, we havent used wands or threats, we just want to go back to school, please let us go back -''
``We are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl!'' shouted the grey centaur, to more neighing
roars of approval from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fellows. ``Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses? We are an
ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults! We do not recognize your laws,
we do not acknowledge your superiority, we are -''
But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment there came a crashing noise on
the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them, Harry, Hermione and the fifty or so centaurs
filling the clearing, looked around. Harrys centaur let him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fall to the ground again as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands
flew to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bow and quiver of arrows. Hermione had been dropped, too, and Harry hurried
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the
giant appeared in the gap.
The centaurs nearest him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) backed into those behind; the clearing was now a forest of bows and
arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing upwards at the enormous greyish face now looming over
them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches. Grawps lopsided mouth was gaping
stupidly; they could see his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half-light, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dull sludgecolored eyes narrowed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) squinted down at the creatures at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. Broken ropes trailed from both ankles.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth even wider.
``Hagger.''
Harry did not know what hagger meant, or what language it was from, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) much care; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was watching Grawps feet, which were almost as long as Harrys whole body. Hermione
gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose huge, round
head moved from side to side as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) continued to peer amongst them as though looking for
something he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had dropped.
``Hagger!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said again, more insistently.
``Get away from here, giant!'' called Magorian. ``You are not welcome among us!''
These words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stooped a little -LRB-the
centaurs arms tensed on their bows-RRB-, then bellowed, ``HAGGER!''
A few of the centaurs looked worried now. Hermione, however, gave a gasp.
``Harry!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) whispered. ``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s trying to say Hagrid!''
At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two humans in a sea of centaurs.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head another foot or so, staring intently at them. Harry could feel Hermione
shaking as Grawp opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling voice, ``Hermy.''
``Goodness,'' said Hermione, gripping Harrys arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was about to faint, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) - he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered!''
``HERMY!'' roared Grawp. ``WHERE HAGGER?''
``I dont know!'' squealed Hermione, terrified. ``Im sorry, Grawp, I dont know!''
``GRAWP WANT HAGGER!''
One of the giants massive hands reached down. Hermione let out a real scream, ran a few steps
backwards and fell over. Devoid of a wand, Harry braced himself to punch, kick, bite or
whatever else it took as the hand swooped towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and knocked a snow-white centaur off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs.
It was what the centaurs had been waiting for -- Grawps outstretched fingers were a foot from
Harry when fifty arrows soared through the air at the giant, peppering his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enormous face, causing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to howl with pain and rage and straighten up, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enormous hands,
breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the arrowheads in still deeper.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) yelled and stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way; pebble-sized
droplets of Grawps blood showered Harry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled Hermione to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet and the pair of
them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees. Once there they looked back; Grawp
was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face; they were retreating in
disorder, galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing. Harry and Hermione
watched Grawp give another roar of fury and plunge after them, smashing more trees aside as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
went.
``Oh no,'' said Hermione, quaking so badly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) knees gave way. ``Oh, that was horrible. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might kill them all.''
``Im not that fussed, to be honest,'' said Harry bitterly.
The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant grew fainter and fainter. As Harry
listened to them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
They had wasted so much time - they were even further from rescuing Sirius than they had been
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had had the vision. Not only had Harry managed to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand but they were stuck in
the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever.
``Smart plan,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spat at Hermione, having to release some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fury. ``Really smart plan. Where
do we go from here?''
``We need to get back up to the castle,'' said Hermione faintly.
``By the time weve done that, Siriusll probably be dead!'' said Harry, kicking a nearby tree in
temper. A high-pitched chattering started up overhead and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up to see an angry
Bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Well, we cant do anything without wands,'' said Hermione hopelessly, dragging herself up
again. ``Anyway, Harry, how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London?''
``Yeah, we were just wondering that,'' said a familiar voice from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).
Harry and Hermione moved together instinctively and peered through the trees.
Ron came into sight, closely followed by Ginny, Neville and Luna. All of them looked a little the
worse for wear - there were several long scratches running the length of Ginnys cheek; a large
purple lump was swelling above Nevilles right eye; Rons lip was bleeding worse than ever -
but all were looking rather pleased with themselves.
``So,'' said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out Harrys wand, ``had any
ideas?''
``How did you get away?'' asked Harry in amazement, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand from Ron.
``Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment
Jinx,'' said Ron airily, now handing back Hermiones wand, too. ``But Ginny was best, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) got
Malfoy - Bat Bogey Hex - it was superb, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) whole face was covered in the great flapping things.
Anyway, we saw you out of the window heading into the Forest and followed. Whatve you done
with Umbridge?''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) got carried away,'' said Harry. ``By a herd of centaurs.''
``And they left you behind?'' asked Ginny, looking astonished.
``No, they got chased off by Grawp,'' said Harry
``Whos Grawp?'' Luna asked interestedly.
``Hagrids little brother,'' said Ron promptly. ``Anyway, never mind that now. Harry, what did you find out in the fire? Has You-Know-Who got Sirius or -?''
``Yes,'' said Harry, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar gave another painful prickle, ``and Im sure Sirius is still alive, but I cant see how were going to get there to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>).''
They all fell silent, looking rather scared; the problem facing them seemed insurmountable.
``Well, well have to fly, wont we?'' said Luna, in the closest thing to a matter-of-fact voice
Harry had ever heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) use.
``Okay,'' said Harry irritably, rounding on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>). ``First of all, we arent doing anything if youre
including yourself in that, and second of all, Rons the only one with a broomstick that isnt
being guarded by a security troll, so -''
``Ive got a broom!'' said Ginny.
``Yeah, but youre not coming,'' said Ron angrily.
``Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!'' said Ginny, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) jaw set so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking.
``Youre too -'' Harry began, but Ginny said fiercely, ``Im three years older than you were when
you fought You-Know-Who over the Sorcerers Stone, and its because of me that Malfoys
stuck back in Umbridges office with giant flying bogies attacking him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) -''
``Yeah, but -''
``We were all in the D.A, together,'' said Neville quietly. ``It was all supposed to be about fighting
You-Know-Who, wasnt it? And this is the first chance weve had to do something real - or was
that all just a game or something?''
``No -- of course it wasnt -'' said Harry impatiently.
``Then we should come too,'' said Neville simply. ``We want to help.''
``Thats right,'' said Luna, smiling happily.
Harrys eyes met Rons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew Ron was thinking exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was: if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could have
chosen any members of the D.A., in addition to himself, Ron and Hermione, to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) in the
attempt to rescue Sirius, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) would not have picked Ginny, Neville or Luna.
``Well, it doesnt matter, anyway,'' said Harry through gritted teeth, ``because we still dont know
how to get there -''
``I thought wed settled that,'' said Luna maddeningly. ``Were flying!''
``Look,'' said Ron, barely containing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) anger, ``you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us cant sprout wings whenever we -''
``There are ways of flying other than with broomsticks,'' said Luna serenely.
``I spose were going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is?'' Ron
demanded.
``The Crumple-Horned Snorkack cant fly,'' said Luna in a dignified voice, ``but they can, and
Hagrid says theyre very good at finding places their riders are looking for.''
Harry whirled round. Standing between two trees, their white eyes gleaming eerily, were two
Thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word.
``Yes!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whispered, moving towards them. They tossed their reptilian heads, throwing back
long black manes, and Harry stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand eagerly and patted the nearest ones shining
neck; how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ever have thought them ugly?
``Is it those mad horse things?'' said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the
Thestral Harry was patting. ``Those ones you cant see unless youve watched someone snuff it?''
``Yeah,'' said Harry.
``How many?''
``Just two.''
``Well, we need three,'' said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just
the same.
``Four, Hermione,'' said Ginny, scowling.
``I think there are six of us, actually,'' said Luna calmly, counting.
``Dont be stupid, we cant all go!'' said Harry angrily. ``Look, you three -'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pointed at Neville,
Ginny and Luna, ``youre not involved in this, youre not -''
They burst into more protests. His (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) scar gave another, more painful, twinge. Every moment they
delayed was precious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) did not have time to argue.
``Okay, fine, its your choice,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) said curtly, ``but unless we can find more Thestrals youre not
going to be able -''
``Oh, more of them will come,'' said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the
wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) was looking at the horses.
``What makes you think that?''
``Because, in case you hadnt noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) said
coolly, ``and we know Hagrid lures Thestrals with raw meat. Thats probably why these two
turned up in the first place.''
Harry felt a soft tug on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral
licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sleeve, which was damp with Grawps blood.
``Okay, then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, a bright idea occurring, ``Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and
Hermione can stay here with you three and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)ll attract more Thestrals -''
``Im not staying behind!'' said Hermione furiously.
``Theres no need,'' said Luna, smiling. ``Look, here come more now... you two must really
smell...''
Harry turned: no fewer than six or seven Thestrals were picking their way through the trees, their
great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had no excuse now.
``All right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said angrily, ``pick one and get on, then.''
CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
The Department of Mysteries
Harry wound his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand tightly into the mane of the nearest Thestral, placed a foot on a stump
nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horses silken back. It did not object, but twisted its head
around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found there was a way of lodging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees behind the wing joints that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feel more
secure, then looked around at the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next
Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creatures back. Luna was
already in place, sitting side-saddle and adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did this every day.
Ron, Hermione and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, open-mouthed
and staring.
``What?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said.
``Howre we supposed to get on?'' said Ron faintly. ``When we cant see the things?''
``Oh, its easy,'' said Luna, sliding obligingly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) Thestral and marching over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>),
Hermione and Ginny. ``Come here...''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) pulled them over to the other Thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help
them on to the back of their mount. All three looked extremely nervous as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) wound their hands
into their horses mane and told them to grip tightly before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) got back on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) own steed.
``This is mad,'' Ron murmured, moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) free hand gingerly up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) horses neck.
``Mad... if I could just see it -''
``Youd better hope it stays invisible,'' said Harry darkly. ``We all ready, then?''
They all nodded and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw five pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes.
``Okay...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked down at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Thestrals glossy black head and swallowed.
``Ministry of Magic, visitors entrance, London, then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said uncertainly. ``Er... if you know...
where to go...''
For a moment Harrys Thestral did nothing at all; then, with a sweeping movement that nearly
unseated him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), the wings on either side extended; the horse crouched slowly, then rocketed
upwards so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms and legs tightly around the horse
to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face down
into the horses silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out
into a blood-red sunset.
Harry did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ever moved so fast: the Thestral streaked over the castle, its wide
wings hardly beating; the cooling air was slapping Harrys face; eyes screwed up against the
rushing wind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked round and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) five fellows soaring along behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), each of them
bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slipstream.
They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogsmeade; Harry could see mountains
and gullies below them. As the daylight began to fail, Harry saw small collections of lights as
they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way
home through the hills...
``This is bizarre!'' Harry barely heard Ron yell from somewhere behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) imagined
how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support.
Twilight fell: the sky was turning to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon
only the lights of Muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were, or
how very fast they were traveling. Harrys arms were wrapped tightly around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) horses neck as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) willed it to go even faster. How much time had elapsed since he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen Sirius lying on the
Department of Mysteries floor? How much longer would Sinus be able to resist Voldemort? All
Harry knew for sure was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) godfather had neither done as Voldemort wanted, nor died, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was convinced that either outcome would have caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to feel Voldemorts jubilation or
fury course through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own body, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr.
Weasley was attacked.
On they flew through the gathering darkness; Harrys face felt stiff and cold, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs numb from
gripping the Thestrals sides so tightly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not dare shift his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) position lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slip... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
deaf from the thundering rush of air in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth was dry and frozen from the cold
night wind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had lost all sense of how far they had come; all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) faith was in the beast beneath
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), still streaking purposefully through the night, barely flapping its wings as it sped ever
onwards.
If they were too late...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s still alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s still fighting, I can feel it...
If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack...
Id know...
Harrys stomach gave a jolt; the Thestrals head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)
actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck. They were descending at last... he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)
heard a shriek behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) and twisted around dangerously, but could see no sign of a falling
body... presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had.
And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides; they could see the
tops of buildings, streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale yellow that
were windows. Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling towards the pavement; Harry
gripped the Thestral with every last ounce of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strength, braced for a sudden impact, but the
horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from its back, looking
around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalized
telephone box, both drained of color in the flat orange glare of the streetlights.
Ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) Thestral on to the pavement.
``Never again,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, struggling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) made as though to stride away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
Thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again. ``Never,
ever again... that was the worst -''
Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>): both slid off their mounts a little more
gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground;
Neville jumped down, shaking; and Luna dismounted smoothly.
``Where do we go from here, then?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) asked Harry in a politely interested voice, as though this
was all a rather interesting day-trip.
``Over here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Thestral a quick, grateful pat, then led the way quickly to the
battered telephone box and opened the door. ``Come on!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) urged the others, as they hesitated.
Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville and Luna squashed themselves in after
them; Harry took one glance back at the Thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside
the skip, then forced himself into the box after Luna.
``Whoevers nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) said.
Ron did it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial; as it whirred back into place the cool female
voice sounded inside the box.
``Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.''
``Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,'' Harry said very quickly, ``Ginny Weasley,
Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood... were here to save someone, unless your Ministry can
do it first!''
``Thank you,'' said the cool female voice. ``Visitors, please take the badges and attach them to the
front of your robes.''
Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins normally appeared.
Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginnys head; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced at
the topmost one, Harry Potter, Rescue Mission.
``Visitors to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for
registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.''
``Fine!'' Harry said loudly, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar gave another throb. ``Now can we move?''
The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows; the
scavenging Thestrals were sliding out of sight; blackness closed over their heads and with a dull
grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic.
A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up their bodies. Harry bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
knees and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand as ready as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could in such cramped conditions as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) peered through
the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed to be
completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by day; there were no fires burning
under the mantelpieces set into the walls, but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw that golden
symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling.
``The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,'' said the womans voice.
The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of it, closely followed by Neville
and Luna. The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain,
where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaurs arrow, the tip of the
goblins hat and the house-elfs ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool.
``Come on,'' said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall, Harry in the lead,
past the fountain towards the desk where the security man who had weighed Harrys wand had
sat, and which was now deserted.
Harry felt sure there ought to be a security person there, sure that their absence was an ominous sign, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately, the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clanking and they dashed inside. Harry stabbed the
number nine button; the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend, jangling and
rattling. Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had come with Mr.
Weasley; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sure the din would raise every security person within the building, yet when the
lift halted, the cool female voice said, ``Department of Mysteries,'' and the grilles slid open. They
stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the
rush of air from the lift.
Harry turned towards the plain black door. After months and months of dreaming about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was here at last.
``Lets go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whispered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) led the way down t he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) corridor, Luna right behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), gazing
around with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth slightly open.
``Okay, listen,'' said Harry stopping again within six feet of the door. ``Maybe... maybe a couple of people should stay here as a -- as a lookout, and --''
``And howre we going to let you know somethings coming?'' asked Ginny, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) eyebrows raised.
``You could be miles away.''
``Were coming with you, Harry,'' said Neville.
``Lets get on with it,'' said Ron firmly.
Harry still did not want to take them all with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but it seemed he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no choice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to
face the door and walked forwards... just as it had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dream, it swung open and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) marched
over the threshold, the others at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heels.
They were standing in a large, circular room. Everything in here was black including the floor
and ceiling; identical, unmarked, handleless black doors were set at intervals all around the black
walls, interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue; their cool, shimmering
light reflected in the shining marble floor made it look as though there was dark water underfoot.
``Someone shut the door,'' Harry muttered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it. Without the long chink of light
from the torchlit corridor behind them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only
things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly
reflections in the floor.
In his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dream, Harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately
opposite the entrance and walked on. But there were around a dozen doors here. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
gazing ahead at the doors opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), trying to decide which was the right one, there was a
great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways. The circular wall was rotating.
Hermione grabbed Harrys arm as though frightened the floor might move, too, but it did not.
For a few seconds, the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall
sped around; then, quite as suddenly as it had started, the rumbling stopped and everything
became stationary once again.
Harrys eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see.
``What was that about?'' whispered Ron fearfully.
``I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in through,'' said Ginny in a hushed
voice.
Harry realized at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) was right: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could no sooner identify the exit door than locate an ant
on the jet-black floor; and the door through which they needed to proceed could be any one of the dozen surrounding them.
``Howre we going to get back out?'' said Neville uncomfortably.
``Well, that doesnt matter now,'' said Harry forcefully, blinking to try to erase the blue lines from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vision, and clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand tighter than ever, ``we wont need to get out till weve found Sirius -''
``Dont go calling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>), though!'' Hermione said urgently; but Harry had never needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
advice less, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) instinct was to keep as quiet as possible.
``Where do we go, then, Harry?'' Ron asked.
``I dont -'' Harry began. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swallowed. ``In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the
corridor from the lifts into a dark room - thats this one - and then I went through another door
into a room that kind of... glitters. We should try a few doors,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said hastily, ``Ill know the
right way when I see it. Cmon.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) marched straight at the door now facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), the others following close behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), set his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
left hand against its cool, shining surface, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand ready to strike the moment it opened,
and pushed.
It swung open easily.
After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling
gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter, though there were no
glittering, shimmering lights as Harry had seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dreams. The place was quite empty except
for a few desks and, in the very middle of the room, an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid,
big enough for all of them to swim in; a number of pearly-white objects were drifting around
lazily in it.
``Whatre those things?'' whispered Ron.
``Dunno,'' said Harry.
``Are they fish?'' breathed Ginny.
``Aquavirius Maggots!'' said Luna excitedly. ``Dad said the Ministry were breeding --''
``No,'' said Hermione. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sounded odd. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) moved forward to look through the side of the tank.
``Theyre brains.''
``Brains?''
``Yes... I wonder what theyre doing with them?''
Harry joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mistake now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw them at close
quarters. Glimmering eerily, they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green liquid,
looking something like slimy cauliflowers.
``Lets get out of here,'' said Harry. ``This isnt right, we need to try another door.''
``There are doors here, too,'' said Ron, pointing around the walls. Harrys heart sank; how big was this place?
``In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``I think we should go
back and try from there.''
So they hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly shapes of the brains were now
swimming before Harrys eyes instead of the blue candle flames.
``Wait!'' said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them.
``Flagrate!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) drew with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand in midair and a fiery X appeared on the door. No sooner had the door
clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling, and once again the wall began to
revolve very fast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue and, when all
became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing the door they had already tried.
``Good thinking,'' said Harry. ``Okay, lets try this one -''
Again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strode directly at the door facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and pushed it open, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand still raised, the
others at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heels.
This room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the center of it was sunken,
forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep. They were standing on the topmost tier of what
seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an
amphitheatre, or the courtroom in which Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot. Instead of a
chained chair, however, there was a raised stone dais in the center of the pit, on which stood a
stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing
was still standing. Unsupported by any surrounding wall, the archway was hung with a tattered
black curtain or veil which, despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air, was
fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched.
``Whos there?'' said Harry, jumping down on to the bench below. There was no answering voice,
but the veil continued to flutter and sway.
``Careful!'' whispered Hermione.
Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the stone bottom of the sunken
pit. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) footsteps echoed loudly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked slowly towards the dais. The pointed archway
looked much taller from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) now stood than it had when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d been looking down on it
from above. Still the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had just passed through it.
``Sirius?'' Harry spoke again, but more quietly now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was nearer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other
side of the archway. Gripping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand very tightly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) edged around the dais, but there was
nobody there; all that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil.
``Lets go,'' called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps. ``This isnt right, Harry, come on,
lets go.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sounded scared, much more scared than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had in the room where the brains swam, yet
Harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it, old though it was. The gently rippling
veil intrigued him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it.
``Harry, lets go, okay?'' said Hermione more forcefully.
``Okay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, but did not move. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just heard something. There were faint whispering,
murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil.
``What are you saying?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, very loudly, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) words echoed all around the stone
benches.
``Nobodys talking, Harry!'' said Hermione, now moving over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Someones whispering behind there,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, moving out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) reach and continuing to frown
at the veil. ``Is that you, Ron?''
``Im here, mate,'' said Ron, appearing around the side of the archway.
``Cant anyone else hear it?'' Harry demanded, for the whispering and murmuring was becoming
louder; without really meaning to put it there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foot was on the dais.
``I can hear them too,'' breathed Luna, joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at
the swaying veil. ``There are people in there!''
``What do you mean, in there?'' demanded Hermione, jumping down from the bottom step and
sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted, ``there isnt any in there, its just an archway, theres no room for anybody to be there. Harry, stop it, come away -''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) grabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm and pulled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) resisted.
``Harry, we are supposed to be here for Sirius!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said in a high-pitched, strained voice.
``Sirius,'' Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerized, at the continuously swaying veil. ``Yeah...''
Something finally slid back into place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain; Sirius, captured, bound and tortured, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
was staring at this archway...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) eyes from the veil.
``Lets go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said.
``Thats what Ive been trying to - well, come on, then!'' said Hermione, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) led the way back
around the dais. On the other side, Ginny and Neville were staring, apparently entranced, at the
veil too. Without speaking, Hermione took hold of Ginnys arm, Ron grabbed Nevilles, and they
marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the
door.
``What dyou reckon that arch was?'' Harry asked Hermione as they regained the dark circular
room.
``I dont know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said firmly, again inscribing a fiery
cross on the door.
Once more, the wall span and became still again. Harry approached another door at random and
pushed. It did not move.
``Whats wrong?'' said Hermione.
``Its... locked...'' said Harry, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) weight at the door, but it didnt budge.
``This is it, then, isnt it?'' said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open.
``Bound to be!''
``Get out of the way!'' said Hermione sharply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand at the place where a lock
would have been on an ordinary door and said, ``Alohomora!''
Nothing happened.
``Siriuss knife!'' said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled it out from inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes and slid it into the crack
between the door and the wall. The others all watched eagerly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran it from top to bottom,
withdrew it and then flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder again at the door. It remained as firmly shut as ever.
What was more, when Harry looked down at the knife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw the blade had melted.
``Right, were leaving that room,'' said Hermione decisively.
``But what if thats the one?'' said Ron, staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing.
``It cant be, Harry could get through all the doors in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dream,'' said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now-useless handle of Siriuss knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket.
``You know what could be in there?'' said Luna eagerly, as the wall started to spin yet again.
``Something blibbering, no doubt,'' said Hermione under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) breath and Neville gave a nervous
little laugh.
The wall slid to a halt and Harry, with a feeling of increasing desperation, pushed the next door
open.
``This is it!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling light. As Harrys eyes became
accustomed to the brilliant glare, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small,
grandfather and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging
the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of
minuscule, marching footsteps. The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering
crystal ball jar that stood at the far end of the room.
``This way!''
Harrys heart was pumping frantically now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew they were on the right track; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) led the
way down the narrow space between the lines of desks, heading, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dream, for
the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was that stood on a desk and
appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering wind.
``Oh, look!'' said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very heart of the bell jar.
Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-bright egg. As it rose in the jar, it
cracked open and a hummingbird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it
fell on the draught its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been
borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg.
``Keep going!'' said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the
eggs progress back into a bird.
``You dawdled enough by that old arch!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) said crossly, but followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) past the bell jar to the only door behind it.
``This is it,'' Harry said again, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart was now pumping so hard and fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt it must
interfere with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) speech, ``its through here -''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced around at them all; they had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and
anxious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked back at the door and pushed. It swung open.
They were there, they had found the place: high as a church and full of nothing but towering
shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs. They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more
candle-brackets set at intervals along the shelves. Like those in the circular room behind them,
their flames were burning blue. The room was very cold.
Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not hear anything or see the slightest sign of movement.
``You said it was row ninety-seven,'' whispered Hermione.
``Yeah,'' breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row. Beneath the branch of blueglowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure fifty-three.
``We need to go right, I think,'' whispered Hermione, squinting to the next row. ``Yes... thats
fifty-four...''
``Keep your wands ready,'' Harry said softly.
They crept forward, glancing behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves, the
further ends of which were in near-total darkness. Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath
each glass orb on the shelves. Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as dull and
dark within as blown light bulbs.
They passed row eighty-four... eighty-five... Harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of
movement, but Sirius might be gagged now, or else unconscious... or, said an unbidden voice
inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) might already be dead...
Id have felt it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) told himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) heart now hammering against his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) Adams apple, Id already
know...
``Ninety-seven!'' whispered Hermione.
They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the alley beside it. There was
nobody there.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)s right down at the end,'' said Harry, whose mouth had become slightly dry. ``You cant see
properly from here.''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) led them between the towering rows of glass balls, some of which glowed softly as they
passed...
``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should be near here,'' whispered Harry, convinced that every step was going to bring the
ragged form of Sirius into view on the darkened floor. ``Anywhere here... really close...''
``Harry?'' said Hermione tentatively, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) did not want to respond. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) mouth was very dry.
``Somewhere about... here...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said.
They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight. There was nobody
there. All was echoing, dusty silence.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might be...'' Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the next alley. ``Or maybe...'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hurried to look down the one beyond that.
``Harry?'' said Hermione again.
``What?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) snarled.
``I... I dont think Sirius is here.''
Nobody spoke. Harry did not want to look at any of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt sick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not understand
why Sirius was not here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had to be here. This was where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), Harry, had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down them. Empty aisle after empty aisle
flickered past. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran the other way, back past his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) staring companions. There was no sign of
Sirius anywhere, nor any hint of a struggle.
``Harry?'' Ron called.
``What?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) did not want to hear what Ron had to say; did not want to hear Ron tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had been
stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts, but the heat was rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing
the brightness of the Atrium above and the others accusing stares...
``Have you seen this?'' said Ron,
``What?'' said Harry, but eagerly this time - it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there, a clue.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) strode back to where they were all standing, a little way down row ninety-seven, but found
nothing except Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelf.
``What?'' Harry repeated glumly.
``Its -- its got your name on,'' said Ron.
Harry moved a little closer. Ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with
a dull inner light, though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many
years.
``My name?'' said Harry blankly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stepped forwards. Not as tall as Ron, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had to crane his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) neck to read the yellowish label
affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball. In spidery writing was written a date of
some sixteen years previously, and below that:
S.P.T. to A.P.W.B.D.
Dark Lord and -LRB-?-RRB-Harry Potter
Harry stared at it.
``What is it?'' Ron asked, sounding unnerved. ``Whats your name doing down here?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf.
``Im not here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, sounding perplexed. ``None of the rest of us are here.''
``Harry, I dont think you should touch it,'' said Hermione sharply, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hand.
``Why not?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said. ``Its something to do with me, isnt it?''
``Dont, Harry,'' said Neville suddenly. Harry looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Nevilles round face was shining
slightly with sweat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not take much more suspense.
``Its got my name on,'' said Harry.
And feeling slightly reckless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers around the dusty balls surface. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
expected it to feel cold, but it did not. On the contrary, it felt as though it had been lying in the
sun for hours, as though the glow of light within was warming it. Expecting, even hoping, that
something dramatic was going to happen, something exciting that might make their long and
dangerous journey worthwhile after all, Harry lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared
at it.
Nothing whatsoever happened. The others moved in closer around Harry, gazing at the orb as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
brushed it free of the clogging dust.
And then, from right behind them, a drawling voice spoke.
``Very good, Potter. Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to me.''
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
Beyond the Veil
Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right;
eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts;
Ginny gave a gasp of horror.
``To me, Potter,'' repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) hand, palm up.
Harrys insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped, and outnumbered two to one.
``To me,'' said Malfoy yet again.
``Wheres Sirius?'' Harry said.
Several of the Death Eaters laughed; a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures
to Harrys left said triumphantly, ``The Dark Lord always knows!''
``Always,'' echoed Malfoy softly. ``Now, give me the prophecy Potter.''
``I want to know where Sirius is!''
``I want to know where Sirius is!'' mimicked the woman to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and
the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harrys eyes.
``Youve got him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>),'' said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest, the dread he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been
fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)s here. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) is.''
``The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo,'' said the woman in a
horrible, mock baby voice. Harry felt Ron stir beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Dont do anything,'' Harry muttered. ``Not yet -''
The woman who had mimicked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) let out a raucous scream of laughter.
``You hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)? You hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)? Giving instructions to the other children as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) thinks of
fighting us!''
``Oh, you dont know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,'' said Malfoy softly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) has a great weakness for
heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). Now give me the prophecy, Potter.''
``I know Sirius is here,'' said Harry, though panic w as causing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest to constrict and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not breathe properly. ``I know youve got him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)!''
More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman laughed loudest of all.
``Its time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,'' said Malfoy. ``Now give
me the prophecy, or we start using wands.''
``Go on, then,'' said Harry, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own wand to chest height. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did so, the five wands of
Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna rose on either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>). The knot in Harrys
stomach tightened. If Sirius really was not here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had led his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) friends to their deaths for no
reason at all...
But the Death Eaters did not strike.
``Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,'' said Malfoy coolly.
It was Harrys turn to laugh.
``Yeah, right!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``I give you this - prophecy, is it? And youll just let us skip off home, will
you?''
The words were hardly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked: ``Accio proph--''
Harry was just ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted ``Protego!'' before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) spell, and though
the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) managed to cling on to it.
``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) mad eyes staring through the
slits in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) hood. ``Very well, then -''
``I TOLD YOU, NO!'' Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. ``If you smash it -!''
Harrys mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no
interest in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) just wanted to get them all out of this alive, to make sure none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friends
paid a terrible price for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stupidity...
The woman stepped forward, away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fellows, and pulled off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hood. Azkaban had
hollowed Bellatrix Lestranges face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a
feverish, fanatical glow.
``You need more persuasion?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chest rising and falling rapidly. ``Very well - take the
smallest one,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ordered the Death Eaters beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). ``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) watch while we torture the little
girl. Ill do it.''
Harry felt the others close in around Ginny; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stepped sideways so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was right in front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>), the prophecy held up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest.
``Youll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told Bellatrix. ``I dont think your
boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>)?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) did not move; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) merely stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) tongue moistening her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) thin mouth.
``So,'' said Harry, ``what kind of prophecy are we talking about, anyway?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not think what to do but to keep talking. Nevilles arm was pressed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
could feel him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) shaking; he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) could feel one of the others quickened breath on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) head.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) mind was
blank.
``What kind of prophecy?'' repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) face. ``You jest, Harry
Potter.''
``Nope, not jesting,'' said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a
weak link, a space through which they could escape. ``How come Voldemort wants it?''
Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses.
``You dare speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) name?'' whispered Bellatrix.
``Yeah,'' said Harry, maintaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to
bewitch it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Yeah, Ive got no problem with saying Vol--''
``Shut your mouth!'' Bellatrix shrieked. ``You dare speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) name with your unworthy lips, you
dare besmirch it with your half-bloods tongue, you dare -''
``Did you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s a half-blood too?'' said Harry recklessly. Hermione gave a little moan in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
ear. ``Voldemort? Yeah, his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) mother was a witch but his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) dad was a Muggle - or has he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) been telling
you lot he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s pure-blood?''
``STUPEF--''
``NO!<div class="bookquote">''
A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestranges wand, but Malfoy had deflected
it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs
there shattered.
Two figures, pearly-white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of
broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak; their voices vied with each other, so that
only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrixs shouts.
'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>... at the solstice will come a new...'' said the figure of an old, bearded man.
``DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) dared - he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) dares -'' shrieked Bellatrix incoherently, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) stands there - filthy half-blood -''
``WAIT UNTIL WEVE GOT THE PROPHECY!<div class="bookquote">'' bawled Malfoy.
'' (<font color='red'><b>half-blood</b></font>)</div>... and none will come after...'' said the figure of a young woman.
The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing
remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had,
however, given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the others.
``You havent told me whats so special about this prophecy Im supposed to be handing over,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, playing for time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone elses.
``Do not play games with us, Potter,'' said Malfoy.
``Im not playing games,'' said Harry, half his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind on the conversation, half on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wandering
foot. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found someones toes and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) they were Hermiones.
``What?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whispered.
``Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the
Department of Mysteries?'' Malfoy sneered.
``I - what?'' said Harry. And for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quite forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) plan. ``What about my scar?''
``What?'' whispered Hermione more urgently behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Can this be?'' said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were
laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lips as
little as possible, ``Smash shelves -''
``Dumbledore never told you?'' Malfoy repeated. ``Well, this explains why you didnt come
earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why -<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>the Lord</b></font>)</div>- when I say now-<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>- you didnt come running when he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording...''
``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)?'' said Harry. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt rather than heard Hermione passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) message to the
others and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. ``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) wanted me to come and
get it, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)? Why?''
``Why?'' Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. ``Because the only people who are permitted to
retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was
made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) attempted to use others to steal it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).''
``And why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) want to steal a prophecy about me?''
``About both of you, Potter, about both of you... havent you ever wondered why the Dark Lord
tried to kill you as a baby?''
Harry stared into the slitted eye-holes through which Malfoys grey eyes were gleaming. Was
this prophecy the reason Harrys parents had died, the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lightning-bolt scar?
Was the answer to all of this clutched in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand?
``Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch
and still gritty with dust. ``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s made me come and get it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)? Why couldnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) come
and get it himself?''
``Get it himself?'' shrieked Bellatrix, over a cackle of mad laughter. ``The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?''
``So, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)s got you doing his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) dirty work for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), has he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)?'' said Harry. ``Like he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) tried to get Sturgis
to steal it - and Bode?''
``Very good, Potter, very good...'' said Malfoy slowly. ``But the Dark Lord knows you are not
unintell--''
``NOW!'' yelled Harry.
Five different voices behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) bellowed, ``REDUCTO!'' Five curses flew in five different
directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit; the towering structure swayed as a
hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there,
their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and
splintered wood now raining down upon the floor -
``RUN!'' Harry yelled, as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall
from above. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seized a handful of Hermiones robes and dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) forwards, holding one
arm over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death
Eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hard in the masked face;
they were all yelling, there were cries of pain, and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed
upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres -
Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny and Luna sprint past him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), their arms over
their heads; something heavy struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on the side of the face but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) merely ducked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head
and sprinted onwards; a hand caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) by the shoulder; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Hermione shout, ``Stupefy!''
The hand released him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at once -
They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could hear footsteps right behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Hermiones voice urging Neville on; straight ahead,
the door through which they had come was ajar; Harry could see the glittering light of the bell
jar; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pelted through the doorway, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand, and
waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them -
``Colloportus!'' gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise.
``Where - where are the others?'' gasped Harry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had thought Ron, Luna and Ginny were ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this
room, but there was nobody there.
``They must have gone the wrong way!'' whispered Hermione, terror in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face.
``Listen!'' whispered Neville.
Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed; Harry put his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ear close to
the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar, ``Leave Nott, leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), I say -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) injuries will
be nothing to the Dark Lord compared to losing that prophecy. Jugson, come back here, we need
to organize! Well split into pairs and search, and dont forget, be gentle with Potter until weve
got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary - Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left;
Crabbe, Rabastan, go right -Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight ahead - Macnair and Avery,
through here - Rookwood, over there - Mulciber, come with me!''
``What do we do?'' Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot.
``Well, we dont stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,'' said Harry. ``Lets get away
from this door.'' They ran as quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny
egg was hatching and unhatching, towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the
room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the
door Hermione had charmed shut.
``Stand aside!'' said a rough voice. ``Alahomora!''
As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione and Neville dived under desks. They could see the
bottom of the two Death Eaters robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly.
``They mightve run straight through to the hall,'' said the rough voice.
``Check under the desks,'' said another.
Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend; poking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand out from under the desk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
shouted, ``STUPEFY!''
A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell backwards into a grandfather clock and
knocked it over; the second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harrys spell and was
pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own wand at Hermione, who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better
aim.
``Avada -
Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to topple and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aim to go awry. Neville overturned a desk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) anxiety to help; and
pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) wand wildly at the struggling pair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) cried:
<div class="bookquote">``EXPELLIARMUS!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Both Harrys and the Death Eaters wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the
entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death
Eater in front, Harry hot on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heels, and Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck by
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done.
<div class="bookquote">``Get out of the way, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage.
Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted:
<div class="bookquote">``STUPEFY!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>The jet of red light had flown right over the Death Eaters shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour-glasses; the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, sprang back up on to the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered -
The Death Eater had snatched up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar.
Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mask had slipped so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
couldnt see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ripped it off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) free hand and shouted: <div class="bookquote">``STUP--''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``STUPEFY!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them. The jet of red light hit the
Death Eater in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) froze, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm still raised, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand fell to the floor
with a clatter and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) collapsed backwards towards the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a dunk, for
the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor, but instead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head sank through
the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came to rest,
sprawled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back on the table, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind.
<div class="bookquote">``Accio wand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>cried Hermione. Harrys wand flew from a dark corner into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
threw it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Right, lets get out of --''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville, horrified. He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) was staring at the Death Eaters head in the bell jar.
All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck: they were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the mans head.
It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skull; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheeks becoming smooth, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz...
A babys head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
struggled to get up again; but even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell
to its previous proportions again; thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin...
<div class="bookquote">``Its Time,''  (<font color='red'><b>proportions</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in an awestruck voice. <div class="bookquote">``Time...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The Death Eater shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could pull himself
together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more...
There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream.
<div class="bookquote">``RON?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before
them. <div class="bookquote">``GINNY? LUNA?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>Hermione screamed.
The Death Eater had pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head out of the bell jar. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) appearance was utterly bizarre, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
tiny babys head bawling loudly while his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions,
narrowly missing Harry, who had ducked. Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) amazement Hermione
seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm.
<div class="bookquote">``You cant hurt a baby!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was no time to argue the point; Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the
Hall of Prophecy and knew, too late, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ought not to have shouted and given away their
position.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them they
took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room, leading back into the black
hallway.
They had run halfway towards it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters
running across the black room towards them; veering left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) burst instead into a small, dark,
cluttered office and slammed the door behind them.
<div class="bookquote">``Collo--''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>began Hermione, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could complete the spell the door had burst open and
the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside.
With a cry of triumph, both yelled:
<div class="bookquote">``IMPEDIMENTA!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry, Hermione and Neville were all knocked backwards off their feet; Neville was thrown over
the desk and disappeared from view; Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly
deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harrys head slammed into the stone wall
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), tiny lights burst in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes and for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was too dizzy and
bewildered to react.
<div class="bookquote">``WEVE GOT HIM!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry. <div class="bookquote">``IN AN OFFICE OFF--''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Silencio!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>cried Hermione and the mans voice was extinguished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) continued to mouth
through the hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mask, but no sound came out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was thrust aside by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fellow Death
Eater.
<div class="bookquote">``Petrificus Totalus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms and legs snapped together and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell forwards, face down on to the rug at Harrys feet, stiff as a board and unable to move.
<div class="bookquote">``Well done, Ha--''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Death Eater Hermione</b></font>)</div>But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wand; a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across Hermiones chest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) gave
a tiny <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lay motionless.
<div class="bookquote">``HERMIONE!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry fell to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) as Neville crawled rapidly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) from under the desk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wand held up in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). The Death Eater kicked out hard at Nevilles head as he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) emerged -
his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) foot broke Nevilles wand in two and connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) face. Neville gave a howl of pain
and recoiled, clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) mouth and nose. Harry twisted around, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own wand held high, and
saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mask and was pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand directly at Harry,
who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the
wizard who had murdered the Prewetts.
Dolohov grinned. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) free hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harrys hand,
to himself, then at Hermione. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) could no longer speak, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) meaning could not have been
clearer. Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)...
<div class="bookquote">``Like you wont kill us all anyway, the moment I hand it over!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
A whine of panic inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head was preventing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thinking properly: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had one hand on
Hermiones shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) properly. Dont let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) be dead, dont let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) be dead, its my fault if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)s dead...
<div class="bookquote">``Whaddever you do, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) hands to
show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) mouth and chin, <div class="bookquote">``dond gib it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Then there was a crash outside the door and Dolohov looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) shoulder - the baby-headed
Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) head bawling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) great fists still flailing
uncontrollably at everything around him (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>). Harry seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chance:
<div class="bookquote">``PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>The spell hit Dolohov before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could block it and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) toppled forwards across his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) comrade, both
of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch.
<div class="bookquote">``Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said at once, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of
sight again. <div class="bookquote">``Hermione, wake up...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whad did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) do to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville, crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) other side, blood streaming from his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) rapidly swelling nose.
<div class="bookquote">``I dunno...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville groped for Hermiones wrist.
<div class="bookquote">``Dats a pulse, Harry, Ib sure id is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt light-headed.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)s alive?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I dink so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps, but all he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby-headed Death Eater in the next room.
<div class="bookquote">``Neville, were not far from the exit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry whispered, <div class="bookquote">``were right next to that circular room...
if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, Ill
bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift... then you could find someone... raise
the alarm...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And whad are you going do do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Neville, mopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bleeding nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sleeve and
frowning at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Ive got to find the others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Ib going do find dem wid you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville firmly.
<div class="bookquote">``But Hermione --''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well dake her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wid us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Ill carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) -- youre bedder at fighding dem dan I ab -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) stood up and seized one of Hermiones arms, glaring at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed
the other and helped hoist Hermiones limp form over Nevilles shoulders.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, snatching up Hermiones wand from the floor and shoving it into Nevilles
hand, <div class="bookquote">``youd better take this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) own wand as they walked slowly towards the
door.
<div class="bookquote">``My grans going do kill be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) nose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) spoke,
<div class="bookquote">``dat was by dads old wand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Harry stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head out of the door and looked around cautiously. The baby-headed Death Eater
was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks,
bawling and confused, while the glass-fronted cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained
Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)s never going to notice us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Cmon... keep close behind me...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway, which now
seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forwards, Neville tottering slightly due to
Hermiones weight; the door of the Time Room swung shut behind them and the walls began to
rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of Harrys head seemed to have unsteadied him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
narrowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart,
Harry saw that Hermiones fiery crosses had faded from the doors.
<div class="bookquote">``So which way dyou reck--?''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open
and three people fell out of it.
<div class="bookquote">``Ron!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>croaked Harry, dashing towards them. <div class="bookquote">``Ginny - are you all -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forwards, seizing the front of Harrys robes and
gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with unfocused eyes, <div class="bookquote">``there you are... ha ha ha... you look funny, Harry... youre
all messed up...''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Rons face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth. Next
moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) knees had given way, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) still clutched the front of Harrys robes, so that Harry
was pulled into a kind of bow.
<div class="bookquote">``Ginny?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said fearfully. <div class="bookquote">``What happened?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>But Ginny shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)
ankle.
<div class="bookquote">``I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) ankles broken, I heard something crack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>whispered Luna, who was bending over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) and who alone seemed to be unhurt. <div class="bookquote">``Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets;
it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry, we saw Uranus up close!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, still giggling feebly. <div class="bookquote">``Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus
- ha ha ha -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Rons mouth and burst.
<div class="bookquote">''- anyway, one of them grabbed Ginnys foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face, but...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) eyes still
closed.
<div class="bookquote">``And what about Ron?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the
front of Harrys robes.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont know what they hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) with,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>said Luna sadly, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) along at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, pulling Harrys ear down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth and still giggling weakly, <div class="bookquote">``you know
who this girl is, Harry? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)s Loony... Loony Lovegood... ha ha ha ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Weve got to get out of here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Luna, can you help Ginny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>said Luna, sticking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) wand behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) ear for safekeeping, then putting an arm around
Ginnys waist and pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) up.
<div class="bookquote">``Its only my ankle, I can do it myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) had
collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Rons arm over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder just
as, so many months ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had pulled Dudleys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around: they had a one in twelve
chance of getting the exit right first time -
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heaved Ron towards a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the
hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped in, led by Bellatrix Lestrange.
<div class="bookquote">``There they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) shrieked.
Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way through the door ahead, flung Ron
unceremoniously from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione: they were all
over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix.
<div class="bookquote">``Colloportus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>shouted Harry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side.
<div class="bookquote">``It doesnt matter!''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said a mans voice. <div class="bookquote">``There are other ways in - WEVE GOT THEM,
THEYRE HERE!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry span around; they were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all
around the walls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came
running to join the first.
<div class="bookquote">``Luna - Neville - help me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went; Harry crashed into a
table and rolled over the top of it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) haste to reach the next door:
<div class="bookquote">``Colloportus!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>There were footsteps running along behind the doors, every now and then another heavy body
would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered; Luna and Neville were bewitching
the doors along the opposite wall - then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard
Luna cry:
<div class="bookquote">``Collo--aaaaaaaaargh...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luna/Luna Lovegood</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned in time to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flying through the air; five Death Eaters were surging into the room
through the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and on to the
floor on the other side where she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lay sprawled, as still as Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Get Potter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellatrix/Bellatrix Lestrange</b></font>)</div>shrieked Bellatrix, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) ran at him (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) dodged her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and sprinted back up the
room; he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy -
<div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who had staggered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards Harry,
giggling. <div class="bookquote">``Hey Harry, there are brains in here, ha h a ha, isnt that weird, Harry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ron, get out of the way, get down -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>But Ron had already pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wand at the tank.
<div class="bookquote">``Honest, Harry, theyre brains - look -Accio brain!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters
turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid
like a leaping fish: for a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared towards Ron,
spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling
like rolls of film-
<div class="bookquote">``Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it -''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards, <div class="bookquote">``Harry come and
touch it; bet its weird -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``RON, NO!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying
behind the brain, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was sure it would not be anything good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) darted forwards but Ron had
already caught the brain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) outstretched hands.
The moment they made contact with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around
Rons arms like ropes.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, look whats happen-- No - no - I dont like it - no, stop - stop -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron/Weasley/WEASLEY</b></font>)</div>But the thin ribbons were spinning around Rons chest now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tugged and tore at them as the
brain was pulled tight against him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) like an octopuss body.
<div class="bookquote">``Diffindo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bonds.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, itll suffocate him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>screamed Ginny, immobilized by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) broken ankle on the floor - then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eaters wands and hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) squarely in the face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious.
<div class="bookquote">``STUBEFY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermiones wand at the oncoming
Death Eaters, <div class="bookquote">``STUBEFY, STUBEFY!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/Hermione Granger/Granger</b></font>)</div>But nothing happened.
One of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) by inches. Harry
and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent off
streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them. Harry
ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange raced right at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>): holding the prophecy high above his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
sprinted back up the room; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from
the others.
It seemed to have worked; they streaked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), knocking chairs and tables flying but not
daring to bewitch him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in case they hurt the prophecy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dashed through the only door still
open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come; inwardly praying that
Neville would stay with Ron and find some way of releasing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ran a few feet into the new
room and felt the floor vanish -
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last,
with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) landed flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back in the sunken
pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the Death
Eaters laughter: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from
bench to bench towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). Harry got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs were trembling so badly they
barely supported him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>): the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand
clutched tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sight. The back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs hit something solid: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had reached the dais where the
archway stood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) climbed backwards onto it.
The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Some were panting as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was. One was
bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the Body-Bind Curse, was leering, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) wand pointing straight
at Harrys face.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter, your race is run,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) mask, <div class="bookquote">``now hand me the
prophecy like a good boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let - let the others go, and Ill give it to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry desperately.
A few of the Death Eaters laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>said Lucius Malfoy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) pale face flushed with
pleasure. <div class="bookquote">``You see, there are ten of us and only one of you... or hasnt Dumbledore ever taught
you how to count?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s dot alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted a voice from above them. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s still god be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harrys heart sank: Neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them, Hermiones
wand held fast in his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) trembling hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Neville - no - go back to Ron -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``STUBEFY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville shouted again, pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) wand at each Death Eater in turn. <div class="bookquote">``STUBEFY!
STUBE--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) arms to his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) sides. He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``Its Longbottom, isnt it''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>sneered Lucius Malfoy. <div class="bookquote">``Well, your grandmother is used to losing
family members to our cause... your death will not come as a great shock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Longbottom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellatrix/Bellatrix Lestrange</b></font>)</div>repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) gaunt face. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I have had the
pleasure of meeting your parents, boy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I DOE YOU HAB!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>roared Neville, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) fought so hard against his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) captors encircling grip
that the Death Eater shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Someone Stun him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>captors</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellatrix/Bellatrix Lestrange</b></font>)</div>said Bellatrix. She (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) looked transported, alive with excitement as she (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) glanced at
Harry, then back at Neville. <div class="bookquote">``No, lets see how long Longbottom lasts before he (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) cracks like his (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``DOND GIB ID DO DEM!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>roared Neville, who seemed beside himself, kicking and writhing
as Bellatrix drew nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) captor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) wand raised. <div class="bookquote">``DOND GIB ID DO DEM,
HARRY!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bellatrix/Bellatrix Lestrange</b></font>)</div>Bellatrix raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) wand. <div class="bookquote">``Crucio!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville screamed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) legs drawn up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) chest so that the Death Eater holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) was
momentarily holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) off the ground. The Death Eater dropped him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) fell to the floor,
twitching and screaming in agony.
<div class="bookquote">``That was just a taster!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellatrix/Bellatrix Lestrange</b></font>)</div>said Bellatrix, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) wand so that Nevilles screams stopped and he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
lay sobbing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) turned and gazed up at Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Potter, either give us the
prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy was hot with the heat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
clutching hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) held it out. Malfoy jumped forwards to take it.
Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room:
Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks and Kingsley.
Malfoy turned, and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>).
Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The
Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who
were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken
floor. Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you okay?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville, trying to pull himself up.
<div class="bookquote">``And Ron?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dink he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s all righd - he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was still fighding de brain when I lefd -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Nevilles
hand had been only seconds before; both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came
out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) upright, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) toes were
barely touching the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Give it to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>growled a voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ear, <div class="bookquote">``give me the prophecy -''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man was pressing so tightly on Harrys windpipe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not breathe. Through
watering eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away; Kingsley was
fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix -
nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand backwards towards the
mans side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the mans free hand was groping
towards the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy -
<div class="bookquote">``AARGH!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Neville had come lunging out of nowhere; unable to articulate a spell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had jabbed Hermiones
wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eaters mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a
howl of pain. Harry whirled around to face him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and gasped:
<div class="bookquote">``STUPEFY!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The Death Eater keeled over backwards and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mask slipped off: it was Macnair, Buckbeaks
would-be killer, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes now swollen and bloodshot.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said to Neville, pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aside as Sirius and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) Death Eater lurched past,
dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs; then Harrys foot made contact with something
round and hard and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slipped. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had dropped the prophecy, but then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Moodys magical eye spinning away across the floor.
Its owner was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) side, bleeding from the head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) attacker was now bearing down
upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) long pale face twisted with glee.
<div class="bookquote">``Tarantallegra!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a
kind of frenzied tap-dance, unbalancing him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) and causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) to fall to the floor again. <div class="bookquote">``Now,
Potter -''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) made the same slashing movement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) wand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had used on Hermione just as Harry
yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Protego!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry felt something streak across his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face like a blunt knife; the force of it knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
sideways and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell over Nevilles jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of
the spell.
Dolohov raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) wand again. <div class="bookquote">``Accio proph--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Sirius had hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) shoulder and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) flying out of
the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harrys fingers but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had managed to
cling on to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks
flying from their wand-tips -
Dolohov drew back his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) wand to make the same slashing movement he (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) had used on Harry and
Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Petrificus Totalus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Once again, Dolohovs arms and
legs snapped together and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) keeled over backwards, landing with a crash on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back.
<div class="bookquote">``Nice one!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>shouted Sirius, forcing Harrys head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew towards
them. <div class="bookquote">``Now I want you to get out of-''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>They both ducked again; a jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius. Across the room Harry
saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) limp form toppling from stone seat to stone
seat and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back towards the fray.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville and run!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry
did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) field of vision, battling with the
pockmarked and no longer masked Rookwood; another jet of green light flew over Harrys head
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) launched himself towards Neville -
<div class="bookquote">``Can you stand?''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bellowed in Nevilles ear, as Nevilles legs jerked and twitched
uncontrollably. <div class="bookquote">``Put your arm round my neck -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville did so - Harry heaved -- Nevilles legs were still flying in every direction, they would
not support him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them: both fell backwards, Nevilles
legs waving wildly like an overturned beetles, Harry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left arm held up in the air to try to
save the small glass ball from being smashed.
<div class="bookquote">``The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy/Lucius</b></font>)</div>snarled Lucius Malfoys voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) ear, and
Harry felt the tip of Malfoys wand pressing hard between his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ribs.
<div class="bookquote">``No - get - off - me... Neville - catch it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself around on his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) back and scooped
the ball to his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own wand
back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder and yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Impedimenta!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Malfoy was blasted off his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) back. As Harry scrambled up again he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around and saw Malfoy
smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) wand at
Harry and Neville again, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between
them.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, round up the others and GO!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes and lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bodily on to the first tier of stone
steps; Nevilles legs twitched and jerked and would not support his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) weight; Harry heaved again
with all the strength he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) possessed and they climbed another step -
A spell hit the stone bench at Harrys heel; it crumbled away and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell back to the step below.
Neville sank to the ground, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) legs still jerking and thrashing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) thrust the prophecy into his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
pocket.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry desperately, hauling at Nevilles robes. <div class="bookquote">``Just try and push with your legs''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave another stupendous heave and Nevilles robes tore all along the left seam - the small
spun-glass ball dropped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) pocket and, before either of them could catch it, one of
Nevilles floundering feet kicked it: it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step
beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had
happened, a pearly-white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any
but them. Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells
surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hear. The figure stopped speaking and
dissolved into nothingness.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, Ib sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>cried Neville, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) face anguished as his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) legs continued to flounder. <div class="bookquote">``Ib so
sorry, Harry, I didnd bean do -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It doesnt matter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Just try and stand, lets get out of -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dubbledore!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harrys shoulder.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``DUBBLEDORE!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway
from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) wand aloft, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) face white and furious. Harry
felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body - they were saved.
Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thoughts of leaving.
Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
there and yelled to the others. One of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the
stone steps opposite. Dumbledores spell pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) back as easily and effortlessly as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
had hooked him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) with an invisible line -
Only one pair was still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck
Bellatrixs jet of red light: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, you can do better than that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) yelled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice echoing around the cavernous room.
The second jet of light hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) squarely on the chest.
The laughter had not quite died from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes widened in shock.
Harry released Neville, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was unaware of doing so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was jumping down the steps
again, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, as Dumbledore, too, turned towards the dais.
It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall: his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) body curved in a graceful arc as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) sank backwards
through the ragged veil hanging from the arch.
Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) godfathers wasted, once-handsome face
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a
moment as though in a high wind, then fell back into place.
Harry heard Bellatrix Lestranges triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing - Sirius had
only just fallen through the archway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) would reappear from the other side any second...
But Sirius did not reappear.
<div class="bookquote">``SIRIUS!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled. <div class="bookquote">``SIRIUS!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had reached the floor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the
curtain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), Harry, would pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back out...
But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the
chest, holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back.
<div class="bookquote">``Theres nothing you can do, Harry -''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), save him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s only just gone through!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We can still reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go...

<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hasnt gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not believe it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would not believe it; still he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fought Lupin with every bit of strength he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had. Lupin did not understand; people hid behind that curtain; Harry had heard them whispering
the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had entered the room. Sirius was hiding, simply lurking out of sight.
<div class="bookquote">``SIRIUS!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) bellowed. <div class="bookquote">``SIRIUS!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) - IS - NOT - DEAD!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>roared Harry. <div class="bookquote">``SIRIUS!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was movement going on around them, pointless bustling, the flashes of more spells. To
Harry it was meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing
mattered except that Lupin should stop pretending that Sirius - who was standing feet from them
behind that old curtain - was not going to emerge at any moment, shaking back his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) dark hair and
eager to re-enter the battle.
Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais. Harry, still staring at the archway, was angry at Sirius
now for keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) waiting
But some part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized, even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never
kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) waiting before... Sirius had risked everything, always, to see Harry, to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... if
Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life
depended on it, the only possible explanation was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not come back... that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) really
was.
Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room,
seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes; Mad-Eye Moody had crawled across the room to
where Tonks lay, and was attempting to revive her (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>); behind the dais there were still hashes of
light, grunts and cries - Kingsley had run forward to continue Siriuss duel with Bellatrix.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood. Harry was
no longer struggling against Lupin, who maintained a precautionary grip on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm nevertheless.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry... Ib really sorry...''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs were still dancing uncontrollably. <div class="bookquote">``Was dad
man - was Sirius Black a - a friend of yours?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>said Lupin quietly, and pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand at Nevilles legs he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Finite.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The spell
was lifted: Nevilles legs fell back to the floor and remained still. Lupins face was pale. <div class="bookquote">``Lets -
lets find the others. Where are they all, Neville?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/Remus Lupin/Remus</b></font>)</div>Lupin turned away from the archway as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) spoke. It sounded as though every word was causing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) pain.
<div class="bookquote">``Deyre all back dere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Longbottom/Neville Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville. <div class="bookquote">``A brain addacked Ron bud I dink he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)s all righd - and
Herbiones unconscious, bud we could feel a bulse''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw Kingsley hit the ground
yelling in pain: Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) aimed
a spell at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) deflected it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was halfway up the steps now
<div class="bookquote">``Harry - no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm from Lupins slackened grip.
<div class="bookquote">``SHE KILLED SIRIUS!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>bellowed Harry. <div class="bookquote">``SHE KILLED HIM ILL KILL HER!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was off, scrambling up the stone benches; people were shouting behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did
not care. The hem of Bellatrixs robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the
room where the brains were swimming...
She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aimed a curse over her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder. The tank rose into the air and tipped. Harry was deluged in
the foul-smelling potion within: the brains slipped and slid over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and began spinning their
long colored tentacles, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Wingardium Leviosa!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and they flew off him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) up into
the air. Slipping and sliding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran on towards the door; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leapt over Luna, who was groaning
on the floor, past Ginny, who said, <div class="bookquote">``Harry - what -?'' (<font color='red'><b>Ginny/Ginny Weasley/GINNY</b></font>)</div>, past Ron, who giggled feebly, and
Hermione, who was still unconscious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and
saw Bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room; beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was the
corridor leading back to the lifts.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ran, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had slammed the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and the walls were already rotating. Once
more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra.
<div class="bookquote">``Wheres the exit?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) shouted desperately, as the wall rumbled to a halt again. <div class="bookquote">``Wheres the way out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The room seemed to have been waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) to ask. The door right behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) flew open and
the corridor towards the lifts stretched ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), torch-lit and empty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ran...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could hear a lift clattering ahead; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sprinted up the passageway, swung around the corner
and slammed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fist on to the button to call a second lift. It jangled and banged lower and lower;
the grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button marked Atrium. The
doors slid shut and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was rising...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around. Bellatrix
was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) looked back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sprinted
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) and aimed another spell at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren:
the spell zoomed past him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and hit the wrought gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that
they rang like bells. There were no more footsteps. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) had stopped running. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crouched
behind the statues, listening.
<div class="bookquote">``Come out, come out, little Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) called in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) mock baby voice, which echoed off the
polished wooden floors. <div class="bookquote">``What did you come after me for, then? I thought you were here to
avenge my dear cousin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harrys seemed to chorus I am! I am! I am! all
around the room
<div class="bookquote">``Aaaaaah... did you love him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), little baby Potter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Hatred rose in Harry such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never known before; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flung himself out from behind the
fountain and bellowed, <div class="bookquote">``Crucio!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Bellatrix screamed: the spell had knocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) off her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) feet, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) did not writhe and shriek with
pain as Neville had - she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) was already back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) feet, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry
dodged behind the golden fountain again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) counter-spell hit the head of the handsome wizard,
which was blown off and landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) yelled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) had abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>)
baby voice now. <div class="bookquote">``You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain - to
enjoy it - righteous anger wont hurt me for long - Ill show you how it is done, shall I? Ill give
you a lesson -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry was edging around the fountain on the other side when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) screamed, <div class="bookquote">``Crucio!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was forced to duck down again as the centaurs arm, holding its bow, span off and landed with a
crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizards head.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter, you cannot win against me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) cried.
He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) moving to the right, trying to get a clear shot of him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) backed around the
statue away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>), crouching behind the centaurs legs, his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) head level with the house-elfs.
<div class="bookquote">``I was and am the Dark Lords most loyal servant. I learned the Dark Arts from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and I know
spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete''
 (<font color='red'><b>the centaur</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stupefy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>yelled Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the
now headless wizard and taken aim at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) back as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) peered around the fountain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) reacted so
fast he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) barely had time to duck.
<div class="bookquote">``Protego!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The jet of red light, his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) own Stunning Spell, bounced back at him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>). Harry scrambled back behind
the fountain and one of the goblins ears went flying across the room.
<div class="bookquote">``Potter, Im going to give you one chance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellatrix/Bellatrix Lestrange</b></font>)</div>shouted Bellatrix. <div class="bookquote">``Give me the prophecy - roll it out towards me now - and I may spare your life!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, youre going to have to kill me, because its gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry roared and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted it,
pain seared across his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar was on fire again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt a surge of fury that was
quite unconnected with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own rage. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) knows!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, with a mad laugh to match
Bellatrixs own. <div class="bookquote">``Your dear old mate Voldemort knows its gone! He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s not going to be happy
with you, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What? What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) cried, and for the first time there was fear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the steps! What do you think
Voldemortll say about that, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar seared and burned... the pain of it was making his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes stream...
<div class="bookquote">``LIAR!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) shrieked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear the terror behind the anger now. <div class="bookquote">``YOUVE GOT IT,
POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME! Accio prophecy! ACCIO PROPHECY!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry laughed again because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew it would incense her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>), the pain building in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head so badly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skull might burst. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) empty hand from behind the one-eared goblin and
withdrew it quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) sent another jet of green light flying at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing to summon! It smashed and nobody heard what it said, tell your boss that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellatrix</b></font>) screamed. <div class="bookquote">``It isnt true, youre lying! MASTER, I TRIED, I TRIED - DO NOT
PUNISH ME''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dont waste your breath!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>yelled Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes screwed up against the pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar, now
more terrible than ever. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) cant hear you from here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cant I, Potter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a high, cold voice.
Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes.
Tall, thin and black-hooded, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scarlet, slit-pupilled
eyes staring... Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) wand pointing at
Harry who stood frozen, quite unable to move.
<div class="bookquote">``So, you smashed my prophecy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Voldemort/Lord Voldemort</b></font>)</div>said Voldemort softly, staring at Harry with those pitiless red
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``No, Bella, he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) is not lying... I see the truth looking at me from within his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) worthless mind... months of preparation, months of effort... and my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Master, I am sorry I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus Black!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellatrix/Bellatrix Lestrange</b></font>)</div>sobbed Bellatrix, flinging
herself down at Voldemorts feet as he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) paced slowly nearer. <div class="bookquote">``Master, you should know''
 (<font color='red'><b>Voldemort/Lord Voldemort</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Voldemort/Lord Voldemort</b></font>)</div>said Voldemort dangerously. <div class="bookquote">``I shall deal with you in a moment. Do you think
I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your sniveling apologies?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Master - he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) is here - he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) is below''
 (<font color='red'><b>Voldemort/Lord Voldemort</b></font>)</div>Voldemort paid no attention.
<div class="bookquote">``I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``You have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry had not even opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth to resist; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind was blank, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand pointing uselessly
at the floor.
But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its
plinth to land with a crash on the floor between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced
off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``What -?''  (<font color='red'><b>Voldemort/Lord Voldemort</b></font>)</div>cried Voldemort, staring around. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) breathed, <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Harry looked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart pounding. Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden
gates.
Voldemort raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) wand and another jet of green light streaked at Dumbledore, who turned
and was gone in a whirling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) cloak. Next second, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had reappeared behind Voldemort and
waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) wand towards the remnants of the fountain. The other statues sprang to life. The statue
of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest,
before it dived at her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>), pinning her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled
towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who
vanished and reappeared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backwards, away from
the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them
both.
<div class="bookquote">``It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore calmly. <div class="bookquote">``The Aurors are on their
way''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``By which time I shall be gone, and you will be dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Voldemort/Lord Voldemort</b></font>)</div>spat Voldemort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) sent another killing
curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guards desk, which burst into
flame.
Dumbledore flicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that
Harry, though shielded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) golden guard, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair stand on end as it passed and this time
Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell,
whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note
reverberated from it - an oddly chilling sound.
<div class="bookquote">``You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?''  (<font color='red'><b>Voldemort/Lord Voldemort</b></font>)</div>called Voldemort, his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) scarlet eyes narrowed over the
top of the shield. <div class="bookquote">``Above such brutality, are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore said calmly,
continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had not a fear in the world, as though
nothing had happened to interrupt his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) stroll up the hall. <div class="bookquote">``Merely taking your life would not
satisfy me, I admit''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!''  (<font color='red'><b>Voldemort/Lord Voldemort</b></font>)</div>snarled Voldemort.
<div class="bookquote">``You are quite wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly
as though they were discussing the matter over drinks. Harry felt scared to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walking
along, undefended, shieldless; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to cry out a warning, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) headless guard kept
shunting him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) backwards towards the wall, blocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) every attempt to get out from behind it.
<div class="bookquote">``Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been
your greatest weakness''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed
centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces,
but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand and
waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself
around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the
fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold on Voldemort at once and turned,
hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished; the snake reared from the floor, ready to strike.
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared, standing
on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood.
<div class="bookquote">``Look out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled.
But even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted, another jet of green light flew at Dumbledore from Voldemorts wand
and the snake had struck.
Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) beak wide and swallowed the jet of
green light whole: he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled and flightless. At the
same moment, Dumbledore brandished his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand in one long, fluid movement - the snake, which
had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp
of dark smoke; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten
glass.
For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering
and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool, slopping wildly over the
sides, drenching the polished floor.
<div class="bookquote">``MASTER!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bellatrix/Bellatrix Lestrange</b></font>)</div>screamed Bellatrix.
Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to run out from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)
statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed: <div class="bookquote">``Stay where you are, Harry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. Harry could not see why: the hall was quite
empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue, and the baby
phoenix Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor
And then Harry's scar burst open and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was gone from the hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly
bound that Harry did not know where his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body ended and the creatures began: they were fused
together, bound by pain, and there was no escape
And when the creature spoke, it used Harrys mouth, so that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) agony he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jaw move
<div class="bookquote">``Kill me now, Dumbledore...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Blinded and dying, every part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) screaming for release, Harry felt the creature use him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
again...
<div class="bookquote">``If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy...''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Let the pain stop, thought Harry... let him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kill us... end it, Dumbledore... death is nothing
compared to this...
And Ill see Sirius again...
And as Harrys heart filled with emotion, the creatures coils loosened, the pain was gone; Harry
was lying face down on the floor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses gone, shivering as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lay upon ice, not
wood...
And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than there should have been...
Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been
guarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but which now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) put them on and
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head a little to find Dumbledores crooked nose inches from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) own.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you all right, Harry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, shaking so violently he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head up properly. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Im -
wheres Voldemort, where - who are all these - whats -''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>The Atrium was full of people; the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst
into life in all the fireplaces along one wall; and streams of witches and wizards were emerging
from them. As Dumbledore pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) feet, Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the
house-elf and the goblin, leading a stunned-looking Cornelius Fudge forward.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was there!''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who was pointing at a pile of
golden rubble on the other side of the hall, where Bellatrix had lain trapped only moments
before. <div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>), Mr. Fudge, I swear it was You-Know-Who, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) grabbed a woman and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Williamson</b></font>) too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>gibbered Fudge, who was wearing pajamas under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just run miles. <div class="bookquote">``Merlins beard - here -

realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was there for the first time -LRB-a few of them raised their wands; others simply looked
amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slipperclad feet left the floor-RRB- - <div class="bookquote">``you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>gasped Fudge, beside himself with amazement. <div class="bookquote">``You-here-I-I''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked wildly around at the Aurors he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and it could not have been
clearer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in half a mind to cry, <div class="bookquote">``Seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cornelius, I am ready to fight your men - and win, again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore in a thunderous
voice. <div class="bookquote">``But a few minutes ago you saw proof, with your own eyes, that I have been telling you
the truth for a year. Lord Voldemort has returned, you have been chasing the wrong man for
twelve months, and it is time - you listened to sense!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I - dont - well''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>blustered Fudge, looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) what to do. When nobody did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Very well - Dawlish! Williamson! Go down to the
Department of Mysteries and see... Dumbledore, you - you will need to tell me exactly - the
Fountain of Magical Brethren - what happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) added in a kind of whimper, staring around
at the floor, where the remains of the statues of the witch, wizard and centaur now lay scattered.
<div class="bookquote">``We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry - Harry Potter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>Fudge wheeled around and stared at Harry, who was still standing against the wall beside the
fallen statue that had guarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) during Dumbledore and Voldemorts duel.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) - here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge goggling</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, goggling at Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Why - whats all this about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall explain everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>repeated Dumbledore, <div class="bookquote">``when Harry is back at school.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizards head lay on the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand at it and muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Portus.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against
the wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more.
<div class="bookquote">``Now see here, Dumbledore!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. <div class="bookquote">``You havent got authorization for that Portkey! You cant do things like that right in front of the Minister for Magic, you - you''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) magisterially over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) half-moon spectacles.
<div class="bookquote">``You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``You
will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) can
return to work. I will give you...''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
pocket and surveyed it... <div class="bookquote">``half an hour of my time tonight, in which I think we shall be more

contact me at Hogwarts. Letters addressed to the Headmaster will find me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Fudge goggled worse than ever; his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) mouth was open and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) round face grew pinker under his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
rumpled grey hair.
<div class="bookquote">``I - you''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) back on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Take this Portkey, Harry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) held out the golden head of the statue and Harry placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand on it, past caring what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did
next or where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall see you in half an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore quietly <div class="bookquote">``One... two... three...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) navel. The polished wooden
floor was gone from beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) feet; the Atrium, Fudge and Dumbledore had all disappeared
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was flying forwards in a whirlwind of color and sound...
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
The Lost Prophecy
Harrys feet hit solid ground; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees buckled a little and the golden wizards head fell with a
resounding dunk to the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around and saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had arrived in Dumbledores
office.
Everything seemed to have repaired itself during the Headmasters absence. The delicate silver
instruments stood once more on the spindle-legged tables, puffing and whirring serenely the
portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads lolling back
in armchairs or against the edge of the picture. Harry looked through the window. There was a
cool line of pale green along the horizon: dawn was approaching.
The silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait,
was unbearable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). If his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), the
pictures would have been screaming in pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked around the quiet, beautiful office,
breathing quickly, trying not to think. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to think... there was no escape...
It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fault Sirius had died; it was all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) fault. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), Harry, had not been stupid enough to
fall for Voldemorts trick, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not been so convinced that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dream
was real, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had only opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as Hermione had
said, banking on Harrys love of playing the hero...
It was unbearable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would not think about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not stand it... there was a terrible hollow
inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not want to feel or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius
had vanished; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent space, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could not stand
it -
A picture behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and a cool voice said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah...
Harry Potter...''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) arms as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) surveyed Harry out of shrewd,
narrow eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas Nigellus/Phineas</b></font>)</div>said Phineas eventually <div class="bookquote">``This
office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful Headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you
here? Oh, dont tell me...''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas Nigellus/Phineas</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave another shuddering yawn. <div class="bookquote">``Another message for my
worthless great-great-grandson?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry could not speak. Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead, but Harry could not
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). To say it aloud would be to make it final, absolute, irretrievable.
A few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride
across the room and seize the doorknob.
It would not turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was shut in.
<div class="bookquote">``I hope this means,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind the
Headmasters desk, <div class="bookquote">``that Dumbledore will soon be back among us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Headmaster</b></font>)</div>Harry turned. The wizard was surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with great interest. Harry nodded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tugged again
on the doorknob behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back, but it remained immovable.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wizard</b></font>)</div>said the wizard. <div class="bookquote">``It has been very dull without him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), very dull indeed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) settled himself on the throne-like chair on which he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) had been painted and smiled benignly
upon Harry
<div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said comfortably. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes.
Holds you in great esteem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>The guilt filling the whole of Harrys chest like some monstrous, weighty parasite, now writhed
and squirmed. Harry could not stand this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not stand being himself any more... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
never felt more trapped inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own head and body, never wished so intensely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could be
somebody; anybody, else...
The empty fireplace burst into emerald green flame, making Harry leap away from the door,
staring at the man spinning inside the grate. As Dumbledores tall form unfolded itself from the
fire, the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake, many of them giving cries
of welcome.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore softly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) did not look at Harry at first, but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew,
from an inside pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes, the tiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawkes</b></font>) placed gently on
the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usually stood.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the baby bird, <div class="bookquote">``you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the nights
events.''
 (<font color='red'><b>baby</b></font>)</div>Harry tried to say, <div class="bookquote">``Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>but no sound came out. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that Dumbledore was
reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) of the amount of damage he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had caused, and although Dumbledore was for once
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) directly, and although his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) expression was kindly rather than accusatory, Harry
could not bear to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``Nymphadora Tonks may need
to spend a little time in St. Mungos, but it seems she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will make a full recovery.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside
grew paler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sure all the portraits around the room were listening closely to every word
Dumbledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been, and why there had been
injuries.
<div class="bookquote">``I know how youre feeling, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore very quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``No, you dont,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice was suddenly loud and strong; white-hot anger leapt
inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); Dumbledore knew nothing about his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) feelings.
<div class="bookquote">``You see, Dumbledore?''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas Nigellus/Phineas</b></font>)</div>said Phineas Nigellus slyly <div class="bookquote">``Never try to understand the students. They
hate it. They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their
own -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Phineas Nigellus/Phineas</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thats enough, Phineas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore.
Harry turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) could see
the Quidditch stadium in the distance. Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy
black dog, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could watch Harry play... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had probably come to see whether Harry was as
good as James had been... Harry had never asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)...
<div class="bookquote">``There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledores voice. <div class="bookquote">``On the contrary... the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry felt the white-hot anger lick his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with
the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) calmness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) empty words.
<div class="bookquote">``My greatest strength, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice shaking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stared out at the Quidditch
stadium, no longer seeing it. <div class="bookquote">``You havent got a clue... you dont know...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What dont I know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>asked Dumbledore calmly.
It was too much. Harry turned around, shaking with rage.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont want to talk about how I feel, all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is part of being human''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``THEN - I - DONT - WANT - TO - BE - HUMAN!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry roared, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seized the delicate
silver instrument from the spindlelegged table beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and flung it across the room; it
shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the pictures let out yells of anger
and fright, and the portrait of Armando Dippet said, <div class="bookquote">``Really!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Armando Dippet</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I DONT CARE!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the
fireplace. <div class="bookquote">``IVE HAD ENOUGH, IVE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END,
I DONT CARE ANY MORE''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that, too. It broke apart on
the floor and the legs rolled in different directions.
<div class="bookquote">``You do care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry
demolishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) office. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) expression was calm, almost detached. <div class="bookquote">``You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I - DONT!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry screamed, so loudly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat might tear, and for a second he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), too; shatter that calm old face, shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), hurt
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), make him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, still more calmly. <div class="bookquote">``You have now lost your mother, your
father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known. Of course you care.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``YOU DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry roared. <div class="bookquote">``YOU - STANDING THERE - YOU''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more help; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to run, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wanted to keep running and never look back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to be somewhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not see the
clear blue eyes staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), that hatefully calm old face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heel and ran to the
door, seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it.
But the door would not open. Harry turned back to Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``Let me out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
shaking from head to foot.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, simply. For a few seconds they stared at each other.
<div class="bookquote">``Let me out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said again.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore repeated.
<div class="bookquote">``If you dont - if you keep me in here - if you don t let me''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``By all means continue destroying my possessions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore serenely. <div class="bookquote">``I daresay I have
too many.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) walked around his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) desk and sat down. behind it, watching Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Let me out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as
Dumbledores.
<div class="bookquote">``Not until I have had my say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you - do you think I want to - do you think I give a - I DONT CARE WHAT YOUVE
GOT TO SAY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry roared. <div class="bookquote">``I dont want to hear anything youve got to say!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore steadily. <div class="bookquote">``Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you
ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know you are close to doing, I would like to have
thoroughly earned it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you talking -?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is my fault that Sirius died,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore clearly. <div class="bookquote">``Or should I say, almost entirely my
fault - I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever
and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they
believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that
there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open
with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort
might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked
into going there tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That blame lies with
me, and with me alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry was still standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was gazing at
Dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was hearing.
<div class="bookquote">``Please sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a request.
Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments
of wood, and took the seat facing Dumbledores desk.
<div class="bookquote">``Am I to understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas Nigellus/Phineas</b></font>)</div>said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harrys left, <div class="bookquote">``that my great-great-grandson - the last of the Blacks - is dead?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Phineas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore.
<div class="bookquote">``I dont believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas Nigellus/Phineas</b></font>)</div>said Phineas brusquely.
Harry turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head in time to see Phineas marching out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) portrait and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
gone to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) other painting in Grimmauld Place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would walk, perhaps, from portrait to
portrait, calling for Sirius through the house...
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, I owe you an explanation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``An explanation of an old mans mistakes.
For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of
the failings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they
forget what it was to be young... and I seem to have forgotten, lately...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The sun was rising properly now; there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains
and the sky above it was colorless and bright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) eyebrows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``I guessed, fifteen years ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, <div class="bookquote">``when I saw the scar on your forehead, what it
might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and
Voldemort.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Youve told me this before, Professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry bluntly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not care about being rude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
did not care about anything very much any more.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you see - it is necessary to start with your scar. For it became apparent, shortly after you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else feeling powerful emotion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry wearily.
<div class="bookquote">``And this ability of yours - to detect Voldemorts presence, even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) is disguised, and to
know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) is feeling when his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) emotions are roused - has become more and more pronounced
since Voldemort returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) own body and his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) full powers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry did not bother to nod. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew all of this already.
<div class="bookquote">``More recently''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, <div class="bookquote">``I became concerned that Voldemort might realize that this
connection between you exists. Sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)
mind and thoughts that he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) sensed your presence. I am speaking, of course, of the night when you
witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Snape told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered.
<div class="bookquote">``Professor Snape, Harry''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore corrected him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) quietly. <div class="bookquote">``But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why I did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked at you for months?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry looked up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see now that Dumbledore looked sad and tired.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry mumbled. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I wondered.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore continued, <div class="bookquote">``I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted
to force his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) more incentives to do so. I was sure that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) realized that our relationship was - or
had ever been - closer than that of headmaster and pupil, he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) would seize his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) chance to use you as
a means to spy on me. I feared the uses to which he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) would put you, the possibility that he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) might
try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of
you in such a way. On those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a shadow
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) stir behind your eyes...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), ready to strike, in those
moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Dumbledore had made eye-contact.
<div class="bookquote">``Voldemorts aim in possessing you, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) demonstrated tonight, would not have been my
destruction. It would have been yours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) hoped, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) possessed you briefly a short while
ago, that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>). So you see, I have been trying, in
distancing myself from you, to protect you, Harry. An old mans mistake...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) sighed deeply. Harry was letting the words wash over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have been so interested
to know all this a few months ago, but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm
inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that was the loss of Sirius; none of it mattered...
<div class="bookquote">``Sirius told me you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of
Arthur Weasleys attack. I knew at once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort had
realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Voldemorts assaults on your mind, I
arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sirius/Sirius Black/Black</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) paused. Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of
Dumbledores desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that
the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledores explanation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the slight clearing of a throat. Phineas Nigellus had still
not returned...
<div class="bookquote">``Professor Snape discovered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas Nigellus/Phineas</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore resumed, '' that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months. Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) body; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) dwelled on the
door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant.
``And then you saw Rockwood, who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) arrest,
telling Voldemort what we had known all along - that the prophecies held in the Ministry of
Magic are heavily protected. Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves
without suffering madness: in this case, either Voldemort himself would have to enter the
Ministry of Magic, and risk revealing himself at last - or else you would have to take it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>).
It became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency''
``But I didnt,'' muttered Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>): a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart. ``I didnt
practice, I didnt bother, I couldve stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione kept telling
me to do it, if I had he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)d never have been able to show me where to go, and - Sirius wouldnt -
Sirius wouldnt''
Something was erupting inside Harrys head: a need to justify himself, to explain -
``I tried to check he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)d really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridges office, I spoke to Kreacher in the
fire and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said Sirius wasnt there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)d gone!''
``Kreacher lied,'' said Dumbledore calmly. ``You are not his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) master, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could lie to you without
even needing to punish himself. Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) - he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) sent me on purpose?''
``Oh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one master for months.''
``How?'' said Harry blankly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hasnt been out of Grimmauld Place for years.''
``Kreacher seized his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) opportunity shortly before Christmas,'' said Dumbledore, ``when Sirius,
apparently, shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) to get out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) took Sirius at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) word, and interpreted this as an order to leave the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) went to the only Black family member for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had any respect left... Blacks cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy''
``How do you know all this?'' Harry said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart was beating very fast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt sick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
remembered worrying about Kreachers odd absence over Christmas, remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turning
up again in the attic...
``Kreacher told me last night,'' said Dumbledore. ``You see, when you gave Professor Snape that
cryptic warning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the
Department of Mysteries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once. I should explain that
members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire
in Dolores Umbridges office. Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in
Grimmauld Place.
<div class="bookquote">``When, however, you did not return from your trip into the Forest with Dolores Umbridge,
Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemorts.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) alerted certain Order members at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued, ``Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley
Shacklebolt and Remus Lupin were at Headquarters when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) made contact. All agreed to go to
your aid at once. Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) needed somebody to
remain at Headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was due there at any moment. In the
meantime he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), Professor Snape, intended to search the Forest for you.
``But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) delegated
to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened. And so it was that when I arrived in
Grimmauld Place shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told me -
laughing fit to burst - where Sirius had gone.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was laughing?'' said Harry in a hollow voice.
``Oh, yes,'' said Dumbledore. ``You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) is not
Secret Keeper for the Order, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could not give the Malfoys our whereabouts, or tell them any of
the Orders confidential plans that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had been forbidden to reveal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was bound by the
enchantments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) kind, which is to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could not disobey a direct order from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
master, Sirius. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort,
yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) from repeating it.''
``Like what?'' said Harry.
``Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you,'' said Dumbledore
quietly. ``Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother.
Voldemort knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, and that you knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
was - but Kreachers information made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) realize that the one person for whom you would go
to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black.''
Harrys lips were cold and numb.
``So... when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night...''
``The Malfoys - undoubtedly on Voldemorts instructions - had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) must find a way of
keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured. Then, if you
decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to pretend he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was
not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the Hippogriff yesterday, and, at the moment when you made
your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs tending to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>).''
There seemed to be very little air in Harrys lungs; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breathing was quick and shallow.
``And Kreacher told you all this... and laughed?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) croaked.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) did not wish to tell me,'' said Dumbledore. ``But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I - persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) - to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.''
``And,'' whispered Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands curled in cold fists on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees, ``and Hermione kept telling
us to be nice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was quite right, Harry,'' said Dumbledore. ``I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve
Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I
also told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think Sinus took me very
seriously, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a humans''
``Dont you blame - dont you - talk - about Sirius like -'' Harrys breath was constricted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) could not get the words out properly; but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) again: he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius. ``Kreachers a lying - foul - he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) deserved -''
``Kreacher is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) has been made by wizards, Harry'' said Dumbledore. ``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is to be
pitied. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobbys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was forced to do Siriuss
bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was enslaved, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) felt no true
loyalty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>). And whatever Kreachers faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to
make Kreachers lot easier''
``DONT TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!'' Harry yelled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who had plainly not understood
Sirius at all, how brave he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was, how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had suffered...
``What about Snape?'' Harry spat. ``Youre not talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), are you? When I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
Voldemort had Sirius he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) just sneered at me as usual -''
``Harry, you know Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front
of Dolores Umbridge,'' said Dumbledore steadily, ``but as I have explained, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) informed the
Order as soon as possible about what you had said. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) who deduced where you had gone
when you did not return from the Forest. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), too, who gave Professor Umbridge fake
Veritaserum when she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) was attempting to force you to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) Siriuss whereabouts.''
Harry disregarded this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape, it seemed to be easing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
own sense of dreadful guilt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>).
``Snape - Snape g - goaded Sirius about staying in the house - he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) made out Sirius was a coward''
``Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>),'' said
Dumbledore.
``Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!'' Harry snarled. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) threw me out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) office!''
``I am aware of it,'' said Dumbledore heavily ``I have already said that it was a mistake for me not
to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous
than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence -''
``Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)<div class="bookquote">'' Harry remembered
Rons thoughts on the subject and plunged on '' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>- how do you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasnt trying to soften me
up for Voldemort, make it easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) to get inside my -''
``I trust Severus Snape,'' said Dumbledore simply ``But I forgot - another old mans mistake - that
some wounds run too deep for the healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
feelings about your father - I was wrong.''
``But thats okay, is it?'' yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalized faces and disapproving mutterings
of the portraits on the walls. ``Its okay for Snape to hate my dad, but its not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher?''
``Sirius did not hate Kreacher,'' said Dumbledore. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) as a servant unworthy of
much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright
dislike... the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused
our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.''
``SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE (<font color='blue'><b>SIRIUS</b></font>) GOT, DID HE (<font color='blue'><b>SIRIUS</b></font>)?'' Harry yelled.
``I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,'' Dumbledore replied quietly. ``Sirius was not a cruel man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was kind to house-elves in general. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no love for Kreacher, because
Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated.''
``Yeah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) did hate it!'' said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice cracking, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back on Dumbledore and
walking away. The sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) walked, without realizing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was doing, without seeing the office at all. ``You
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) stay shut up in that house and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) hated it, thats why he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wanted to get out last night''
``I was trying to keep Sirius alive,'' said Dumbledore quietly
``People dont like being locked up!'' Harry said furiously, rounding on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``You did it to me all
last summer''
Dumbledore closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) eyes and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) longfingered hands. Harry watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did
not soften him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>). On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of
weakness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had no business being weak when Harry wanted to rage and storm at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Dumbledore lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) hands and surveyed Harry through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) half-moon glasses.
``It is time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, ``for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything. I ask only a little patience. You will have your
chance to rage at me - to do whatever you like - when I have finished. I will not stop you.''
Harry glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for a moment, then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore
and waited.
Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at
Harry and said, ``Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned
and intended. Well - not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on
your aunt and uncles doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) paused. Harry said nothing.
``You might ask - and with good reason - why it had to be so. Why could some wizarding family
not have taken you in? Many would have done so more than gladly, would have been honored
and delighted to raise you as a son.
``My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps
anyone but I realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) supporters - and
many of them are almost as terrible as he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) - were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And I
had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was
gone for ever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) returned,
but I was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) as I have done, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) would
not rest until he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) killed you.
``I knew that Voldemorts knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be
invincible if he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) ever returned to full power.
<div class="bookquote">``But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be
protected by an ancient magic of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) knows, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) despises, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) has always,
therefore, underestimated - to his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died
to save you. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave you a lingering protection he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) never expected, a protection that flows in
your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mothers blood. I delivered you to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
sister, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only remaining relative.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesnt love me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry at once. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesnt give a damn -''

unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took you, and in doing so, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sealed the charm I placed upon
you. Your mothers sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``While you can still call home the place where your mothers blood dwells, there you cannot be

blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still
call it home, while you are there he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I
had done in the letter I left, with you, on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) doorstep. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) knows that allowing you houseroom
may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Wait a moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat up straighter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair, staring at Dumbledore.

arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well-nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet
alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have
hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well.
``And then... well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly
as I do. You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and sooner - much sooner - than I
had anticipated, you found yourself face to face with Voldemort. You survived again. You did
more. You delayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) return to full power and strength. You fought a mans fight. I was...
prouder of you than I can say.
<div class="bookquote">``Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``An obvious flaw that I
knew, even then, might be the undoing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my
plan should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it. I alone could
prevent this, so I alone must be strong. And here was my first test, as you lay in the hospital
wing, weak from your struggle with Voldemort.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont understand what youre saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Dont you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``Ought I to have told you then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart was racing again.
``You do not see the flaw in the plan yet? No... perhaps not. Well, as you know, I decided not to
answer you. Eleven, I told myself, was much too young to know. I had never intended to tell you
when you were eleven. The knowledge would be too much at such a young age.
``I should have recognized the danger signs then. I should have asked myself why I did not feel
more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give
a terrible answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do
it on that particular day... YOU were too young, much too young.
``And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again you met challenges even
grown wizards have never faced: once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams.
You did not ask me again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark on you. We discussed
your scar, oh yes... we came very, very close to the subject. Why did I not tell you everything?
``Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than eleven to receive such
information. I allowed you to leave my presence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if
I felt a twinge of unease that I ought, perhaps, to have told you then, it was swiftly silenced. You
were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph...
<div class="bookquote">``Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dont -''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cared about you too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore/DUMBLEDORE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore simply. ``I cared more for your happiness than
your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the
lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we
fools who love to act.
``Is there a Defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have - and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined - not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were
slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I
never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.
``We entered your third year. I watched from afar as you struggled to repel Dementors, as you
found Sirius, learned what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was and rescued him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>). Was I to tell you then, at the moment when
you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry? But now, at the age
of thirteen, my excuses were running out. Young you might be, but you had proved you were
exceptional. My conscience was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon...
``But you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric Diggory die, having escaped
death so narrowly yourself... and I did not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had
returned, I must do it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the
knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved that I should have placed
the burden upon you before this. My only Defense is this: I have watched you struggling under
more burdens than any student who as ever passed through this school and I could not bring
myself to add another - the greatest one of all.''
Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.
``I still dont understand.''
``Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before
your birth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) knew the prophecy had been made, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) did not know its full contents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)
set out to kill you when you were still a baby, believing he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was fulfilling the terms of the
prophecy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) discovered, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) cost, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you
backfired. And so, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) last year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety. This is the
weapon he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) has been seeking so assiduously since his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) return: the knowledge of how to destroy
you.''
The sun had risen fully now: Dumbledores office was bathed in it. The glass case in which the
sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments
Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), the baby Fawkes made
soft chirruping noises in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawkes</b></font>) nest of ashes.
``The prophecys smashed,'' Harry said blankly. ``I was pulling Neville up those benches in the -
the room where the archway was, and I ripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) robes and it fell...''
``The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of
Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling
it perfectly''
``Who heard it?'' asked Harry, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew the answer already
``I did,'' said Dumbledore. ``On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the
Hogs Head inn. I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it
was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all. The applicant,
however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very famous, very gifted Seer and I thought it
common politeness to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had not a trace of
the gift herself. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), courteously I hope, that I did not think she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would be suitable for the
post. I turned to leave.''
Dumbledore got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside
Fawkess perch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawkes</b></font>) bent down, slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin,
carved with runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father tormenting Snape.
Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
own temple. From it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand
and deposited them into the basin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) sat back down behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) desk and watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) thoughts
swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. Then, with a sigh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand and
prodded the silvery substance with its tip.
A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes magnified to enormous size behind her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) glasses,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) revolved slowly; her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feet in the basin. But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke, it was not in
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) usual ethereal, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) use once
before:
``The one with the power to vanquish the - Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) equal, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...''
The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished.
The silence within the office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor any of the
portraits made a sound. Even Fawkes had fallen silent.
``Professor Dumbledore?'' Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, still staring at the Pensieve,
seemed completely lost in thought. ``It... did that mean... what did that mean?''
``It meant,'' said Dumbledore, ``that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord
Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago. This boy would be
born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times.''
Harry felt as though something was closing in on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breathing seemed difficult again.
``It means - me?''
Dumbledore surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) for a moment through his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) glasses.
``The odd thing, Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said softly, ``is that it may not have meant you at all. Sibylls prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.''
``But then... but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not Nevilles?''
``The official record was re-labeled after Voldemorts attack on you as a child,'' said
Dumbledore. ``It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only
have tried to kill you because he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.''
``Then - it might not be me?'' said Harry
``I am afraid,'' said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a great effort,
``that there is no doubt that it is you.''
``But you said - Neville was born at the end of July, too - and his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) mum and dad -''
``You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who
could vanquish Voldemort... Voldemort himself would mark him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) equal. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) did,
Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chose you, not Neville. He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.''
``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) might have chosen wrong!'' said Harry. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) might have marked the wrong person!''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) chose the boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) thought most likely to be a danger to him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>),'' said Dumbledore. ``And notice
this, Harry: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chose, not the pureblood -LRB-which, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) creed, is the only kind of wizard
worth being or knowing-RRB- but the half-blood, like himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw himself in you before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not kill you, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) intended, but gave
you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) not once, but four times so far -
something that neither your parents, nor Nevilles parents, ever achieved.''
``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) do it, then?'' said Harry, who felt numb and cold. ``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) try and kill me as a
baby? He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were
older and tried to kill whoever it was then -''
``That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,'' said Dumbledore, ``except that
Voldemorts information about the prophecy was incomplete. The Hogs Head inn, which Sibyll
chose for its cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more interesting clientele than the
Three Broomsticks. As you and your friends found out to your cost, and I to mine that night, it is
a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard. Of course, I had not
dreamed, when I set out to meet Sibyll Trelawney, that I would hear anything worth overhearing.
My - our - one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way
into the prophecy and thrown from the building.''
``So he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) only heard -?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) heard only the beginning, the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had
thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) could not warn his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) master that to attack you would be
to risk transferring power to you, and marking you as his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) equal. So Voldemort never knew that
there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait, to learn more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) did not
know that you would have power the Dark Lord knows not-''
``But I dont!'' said Harry, in a strangled voice. ``I havent any powers he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hasnt got, I couldnt
fight the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) did tonight, I cant possess people or - or kill them -''
``There is a room in the Department of Mysteries,'' interrupted Dumbledore, ``that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than
human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many
subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such
quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. That
power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) could not bear to reside in a
body so full of the force he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your
mind. It was your heart that saved you.''
Harry closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died... More to
stave off the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring
much about the answer, ``The end of the prophecy... it was something about neither... can live...<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>... while the other survives,'' said Dumbledore.
``So,'' said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
``so does that mean that... that one of us has got to kill the other one... in the end?''
``Yes,'' said Dumbledore.
For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the office walls, Harry could hear
the sound of voices, students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It
seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food, who laughed,
who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone forever. Sirius seemed a million miles
away already; even now a part of Harry still believed that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had only pulled back that veil, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
would have found Sirius looking back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), greeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), perhaps, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) laugh like a bark...
``I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,'' said Dumbledore hesitantly. ``You may, perhaps,
have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect? I must confess... that I rather thought... you
had enough responsibility to be going on with.''
Harry looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledores face into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) long silver
beard.
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
The Second War Begins
HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED RETURNS
``In a brief statement on Friday night, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge confirmed that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned to this country and is active once more.
<div class="bookquote">''It is with great regret that I must confirm that t he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wizard styling himself Lord - well, you know
who I mean - is alive and among us again, said Fudge, looking tired and flustered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
addressed reporters. It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the
Dementors of Azkaban, who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministrys
employ. We believe the Dementors are currently taking direction from Lord - Thingy.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Magic Cornelius Fudge</b></font>)</div>We urge the magical population to remain vigilant. The Ministry is currently publishing guides
to elementary home and personal Defense which will be delivered free to all wizarding homes
within the coming month.
The Ministers statement was met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding community, which
as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry assurances that there was no truth
whatsoever in these persistent rumors that You-Know-Who is operating amongst us once
more.
``Details of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy, though it is believed that
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and a select band of followers -LRB-known as Death Eaters-RRB- gained
entry to the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening.
``Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry, reinstated member of the International Confederation of Wizards and reinstated Chief
Warlock of the Wizengamot, has so far been unavailable for comment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) has insisted over the
past year that You-Know-Who is not dead, as was widely hoped and believed, but is recruiting
followers once more for afresh attempt to seize power. Meanwhile, the Boy Who Lived -''
``There you are, Harry, I knew theyd drag you into it somehow,'' said Hermione, looking over the top of the paper at him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>).
They were in the hospital wing. Harry was sitting on the end of Rons bed and they were both
listening to Hermione read the front page of the Sun day Prophet. Ginny, whose ankle had been
mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of Hermiones bed; Neville,
whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape, was in a chair between the
two beds; and Luna, who had dropped in to visit, clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was reading the magazine upside-down and apparently not taking in a word Hermione was saying.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s the boy who lived again now, though, isnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?'' said Ron darkly. ``Not such a deluded
show-off any more, eh?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the immense pile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bedside cabinet,
threw a few to Harry, Ginny and Neville and ripped off the wrapper of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) own with his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) teeth.
There were still deep welts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) forearms where the brains tentacles had wrapped around him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>).
According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else,
though since she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) had started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubblys Oblivious Unction there
seemed to have been some improvement.
``Yes, theyre very complimentary about you now, Harry,<div class="bookquote">'' said Hermione, scanning down the
article. '' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>A lone voice of truth... perceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) story... forced to bear ridicule and slander...  Hmmm,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, frowning, ``I notice they dont mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering in the Prophet...''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) winced slightly and put a hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) ribs. The curse Dolohov had used on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), though less
effective than it would have been had he (<font color='blue'><b>Dolohov</b></font>) been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless
caused, in Madam Pomfreys words, quite enough damage to be going on with. Hermione was
having to take ten different types of potion every day, was improving greatly, and was already
bored with the hospital wing.
``You-Know-Whos Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four, What the Ministry Should
Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore, pages six to eight,
Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter, page nine... Well,'' said Hermione, folding up the
newspaper and throwing it aside, ``its certainly given them lots to write about. And that interview with Harry isnt exclusive, its the one that was in The Quibbler months ago...''
``Daddy sold it to them,'' said Luna vaguely, turning a page of The Quibbler. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got a very good
price for it, too, so were going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer to see if we can
catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack.''
Hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, then said, ``That sounds lovely''
Ginny caught Harrys eye and looked away quickly, grinning.
``So, anyway,'' said Hermione, sitting up a little straighter and wincing again, ``whats going on in school?''
``Well, Flitwicks got rid of Fred and Georges swamp,'' said Ginny, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) did it in about three
seconds. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) left a tiny patch under the window and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)s roped it off''
``Why?'' said Hermione, looking startled.
``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) just says it was a really good bit of magic,'' said Ginny, shrugging.
``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) left it as a monument to Fred and George,'' said Ron, through a mouthful of chocolate.
``They sent me all these, you know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?''
Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, ``So has all the trouble stopped now
Dumbledores back?''
``Yes,'' said Neville, ``everythings settled right back to normal.''
``I spose Filch is happy, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)?'' asked Ron, propping a Chocolate Frog Card featuring
Dumbledore against his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) water jug.
``Not at all,'' said Ginny ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)s really, really miserable, actually...'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) voice to a
whisper. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts...''
All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up
at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) from the centaurs; how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had done it - how he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so
much as a scratch on him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) - nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had
returned to the castle she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody
really knew what was wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), either. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and
there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it, but otherwise she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) seemed to be quite unscathed.
``Madam Pomfrey says she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>)s just in shock,'' whispered Hermione.
``Sulking, more like,'' said Ginny
``Yeah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) shows signs of life if you do this,'' said Ron, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tongue he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) made soft clipclopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly.
``Anything wrong, Professor?'' called Madam Pomfrey, poking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) head around her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) office door.
``No... no...'' said Umbridge, sinking back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) pillows. ``No, I must have been dreaming...''
Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.
``Speaking of centaurs,'' said Hermione, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had recovered a little, ``whos Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)s got to,'' said Harry, ``the other centaurs wont take him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) back, will they?''
``It looks like he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) and Trelawney are both going to teach,'' said Ginny
``Bet Dumbledore wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) couldve got rid of Trelawney for good,'' said Ron, now munching on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fourteenth Frog. ``Mind you, the whole subjects useless if you ask me, Firenze isnt a lot
better...''
``How can you say that?'' Hermione demanded. ``After weve just found out that there are real
prophecies?''
Harrys heart began to race. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not told Ron, Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy
had contained. Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) up the steps in
the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not ready to see their
expressions when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must be either murderer or victim, there was no other
way...
``It is a pity it broke,'' said Hermione quietly, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head.
``Yeah, it is,'' said Ron. ``Still, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either -
where are you going?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) added, looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up.
``Er - Hagrids,'' said Harry. ``You know, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) just got back and I promised Id go down and see him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) how you two are.''
``Oh, all right then,'' said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of
bright blue sky beyond. ``Wish we could come.''
``Say hello to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for us!'' called Hermione, as Harry proceeded down the ward. ``And ask him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
whats happening about... about his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) little friend!''
Harry gave a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand to show he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard and understood as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left the dormitory.
The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was clearly out in the sunny
grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered
by revision or homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of
windows as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and
a couple of students swimming in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was finding it hard to decide whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to be with people or not; whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in
company he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to get away and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted company. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
might really go and visit Hagrid, though, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) properly since he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)d
returned...
Harry had just descended the last marble step into the Entrance Hall when Malfoy, Crabbe and
Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common
room. Harry stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. The only sounds were the shouts,
laughter and splashes drifting into the Hall from the grounds through the open front doors.
Malfoy glanced around - Harry knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was checking for signs of teachers - then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked back
at Harry and said in a low voice, ``Youre dead, Potter.''
Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyebrows.
``Funny'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, ``youd think Id have stopped walking around...''
Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the
sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pale, pointed face contorted with rage.
``Youre going to pay,'' said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper. ``Im going to make
you pay for what youve done to my father...''
``Well, Im terrified now,'' said Harry sarcastically. ``I spose Lord Voldemorts just a warm-up act compared to you three - whats the matter?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added, for Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had all
looked stricken at the sound of the name. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)s your dads mate, isnt he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)? Not scared of him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>),
are you?''
``You think youre such a big man, Potter,'' said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle
flanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>). ``You wait. Ill have you. You cant land my father in prison''
``I thought I just had,'' said Harry.
``The Dementors have left Azkaban,'' said Malfoy quietly. ``Dad and the othersll be out in no
time...''
``Yeah, I expect they will,'' said Harry ``Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are
now''
Malfoys hand flew towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, but Harry was too quick for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own
wand before Malfoys fingers had even entered the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) robes.
``Potter!''
The voice rang across the Entrance Hall. Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) office and at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt
towards Malfoy... whatever Dumbledore said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) would never forgive Snape... never...
``What are you doing, Potter?'' said Snape, as coldly as ever, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) strode over to the four of them.
``Im trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,'' said Harry fiercely.
Snape stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
``Put that wand away at once,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said curtly. ``Ten points from Gryff-''
Snape looked towards the giant hour-glasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile.
``Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-glass to take away. In that
case, Potter, we will simply have to -''
``Add some more?''
Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle; she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) was carrying a
tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) other, but otherwise
looked quite well.
``Professor McGonagall!'' said Snape, striding forwards. ``Out of St. Mungos, I see!''
``Yes, Professor Snape,'' said Professor McGonagall, shrugging off her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) traveling cloak, ``Im quite as good as new. You two - Crabbe - Goyle''
She (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came, shuffling their large feet and looking
awkward.
``Here,'' said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) carpetbag into Crabbes chest and her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) cloak into Goyles; ``take these up to my office for me.''
They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase.
``Right then,'' said Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hourglasses on the wall. ``Well, I think Potter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You-Know-Who! What say you, Professor Snape?''
``What?'' snapped Snape, though Harry knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard perfectly well. ``Oh - well - I
suppose...''
``So thats fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom and Miss Granger,'' said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindors hour-glass as she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) spoke. ``Oh - and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) added, and a number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaws glass. ``Now, you wanted to take ten from Mr. Potter, I think, Professor Snape - so there we are...''
A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless.
``Well, Potter, Malfoy I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this,'' Professor
McGonagall continued briskly.
Harry did not need telling twice- he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand back inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes and headed straight for
the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy.
The hot sun hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) with a blast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) walked across the lawns towards Hagrids cabin. Students
lying around on the grass sunbathing, talking, reading the Sunday Prophet and eating sweets,
looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) passed; some called out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>), or else waved, clearly eager to show that
they, like the Prophet, had decided he (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) was something of a hero. Harry said nothing to any of
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had so
far avoided being questioned and preferred to keep it that way.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought at first when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knocked on Hagrids cabin door that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was out, but then Fang came
charging around the corner and almost bowled him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) over with the enthusiasm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) welcome.
Hagrid, it transpired, was picking runner beans in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) back garden.
``All righ, Harry!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) said, beaming, when Harry approached the fence. ``Come in, come in, well have a cup o dandelion juice...''
``Hows things?'' Hagrid asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), as they settled d own at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wooden table with a glass apiece
of iced juice. ``Yeh - er - feelin all righ, are yeh?''
Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrids face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not referring to Harrys
physical well-being.
``Im fine,'' Harry said quickly, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could no t bear to discuss the thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew was in Hagrids mind. ``So, wherere you been?''
``Bin hidin out in the mountains,'' said Hagrid. ``Up in a cave, like Sirius did when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) -''
Hagrid broke off, cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat gruffly, looked at Harry, and took a long draught of juice.
``Anyway, back now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said feebly.
``You - you look better,'' said Harry, who was determined to keep the conversation moving away
from Sirius.
``Wha?'' said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face. ``Oh - oh yeah. Well, Grawpys loads better behaved now, loads. Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)s a good lad, really... Ive bin thinkin abou tryin ter find him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) a lady friend, actually...''
Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once; the prospect of a
second giant taking up residence in the Forest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp,
was positively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the
point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was starting to wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was alone again, and with the idea of hastening his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) departure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
took several large gulps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dandelion juice, half-emptying his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glass.
``Evryone knows yehve bin tellin the truth now, Harry,'' said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was watching Harry closely. ``Thas gotta be better, hasn it?''
Harry shrugged.
``Look...'' Hagrid leaned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) across the table, ``I knew Sirius longer n yeh did... he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) died in battle, an thas the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)dve wanted ter go -''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) didnt want to go at all!'' said Harry angrily.
Hagrid bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) great shaggy head...
``Nah, I don reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) did,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said quietly. ``But s till, Harry... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was never one ter sit aroun at home an let other people do the fightin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldnve lived with himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadn gone ter
help -''
Harry leapt up.
``Ive got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said mechanically.
``Oh,'' said Hagrid, looking rather upset. ``Oh... all righ then, Harry... take care o yerself then, an drop back in if yehve got a -''
``Yeah... right...''
Harry crossed to the door as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could and pulled it open; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was out in the sunshine again
before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye, and walking away across the lawn. Once again,
people called out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes for a few moments, wishing they would
all vanish, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could open his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes and find himself alone in the grounds...
A few days ago, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) exams had finished and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen the vision Voldemort had planted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had been telling the truth, for them to believe that Voldemort was back, and to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was neither a liar nor mad. Now, however...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) walked a short way around the lake, sat down on its bank, sheltered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared out over the gleaming water, thinking...
Perhaps the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) wanted to be alone was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had felt isolated from everybody since
his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) talk with Dumbledore. An invisible barrier separated him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) from the rest of the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) was -
he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had always been - a marked man. It was just that he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had never really understood what that
meant...
And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake, with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>),
with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) could not muster any great sense of fear. It was
sunny, and the grounds around him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) were full of laughing people, and even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) felt as
distant from them as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) belonged to a different race, it was still very hard to believe as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
sat here that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) life must include, or end in, murder...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to think about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) godfather or to
remember that it was directly across from here, on the opposite bank, that Sirius had once
collapsed trying to fend off a hundred Dementors...
The sun had set before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was cold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) got up and returned to the castle, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
face on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) sleeve as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) went.
Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term.
Hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but Ron tended to make `hushing
noises every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) name. Harry was still not sure whether or not he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to
talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) godfather yet; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wishes varied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew one thing, though:
unhappy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt at the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was back at number four, Privet Drive. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) now understood exactly why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to
return there every summer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not feel any better about it. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
return more.
Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. It seemed she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) had crept out of
the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) met Peeves on the way, who seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) last chance to do as Fred had instructed, and
chased her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) gleefully from the premises whacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) alternately with a walking stick and a sock
full of chalk. Many students ran out into the Entrance Hall to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) running away down the
path and the Heads of Houses tried only half-heartedly to restrain them. Indeed, Professor
McGonagall sank back into her (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was
clearly heard to express a regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>McGonagall</b></font>) could not run cheering after Umbridge herself, because
Peeves had borrowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Umbridge</b></font>) walking stick.
Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading
down to the end-of-term feast, but Harry had not even started.
``Just do it tomorrow!'' said Ron, who was waiting by the door of their dormitory. ``Come on, Im
starving.''
``I wont be long... look, you go ahead...''
But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no effort to speed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) packing.
The very last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wanted to do was to attend the Leaving Feast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was worried that
Dumbledore would make some reference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was sure to mention
Voldemorts return; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had talked to them about it last year, after all...
Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk to make way for folded
ones and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not
think what it was doing there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bent down, pulled it out from underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trainers and
examined it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) just inside the front door of
number twelve Grimmauld Place. Use it if you need me, all right?
Harry sank down on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small, square mirror. It
looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own reflection looking
back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note from Sirius.
This is a two-way mirror, Ive got the other. If you need to speak to me, just say my name into it; youll appear in my mirror and Ill be able to talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions.
Harrys heart began to race. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four
years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to be able to talk to Sirius again, right now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) knew it -
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) face with trembling hands and said, loudly and
clearly, ``Sirius.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) breath misted the surface of the glass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding
through him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), but the eyes blinking back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) through the fog were definitely his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) own.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room:
``Sirius Black!''
Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still, definitely, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
own...
Sirius didnt have his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) mirror on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) went through the archway, said a small voice in
Harrys head. Thats why its not working...
Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it
shattered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to see Sirius,
talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) again...
Disappointment was burning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) throat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) got up and began throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) things pell-mell into
the trunk on top of the broken mirror -
But then an idea struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)... a better idea than a mirror... a much bigger, more important
idea... how had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) never thought of it before - why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) never asked?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase hitting the walls as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) ran
and barely noticing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) hurtled across the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off
along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>): ``The feast is about to start, you
know, youre cutting it very fine!''
But Harry had no intention of going to the feast...
How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didnt need one, yet now...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead. They were all,
clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) Charms classroom he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) came to a halt, panting and thinking
disconsolately that he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) would have to wait until later, until after the end of the feast...
But just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had given up hope, he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) saw it - a translucent somebody drifting across the end of
the corridor.
``Hey - hey Nick! NICK!''
The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and
dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington.
``Good evening,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) said, withdrawing the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) body from the solid stone and smiling at
Harry ``I am not the only one who is late, then? Though,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sighed, ``in a rather different sense, of course...''
``Nick, can I ask you something?''
A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nicks face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) inserted a finger in the
stiff ruff at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) neck and tugged it a little straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>)
desisted only when his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely.
``Er - now, Harry?'' said Nick, looking discomfited. ``Cant it wait until after the feast?''
``No - Nick - please,'' said Harry, ``I really need to talk to you. Can we go in here?''
Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed.
``Oh, very well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) said, looking resigned. ``I cant pretend I havent been expecting it.''
Harry was holding the door open for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) drifted through the wall instead.
``Expecting what?'' Harry asked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) closed the door.
``You to come and find me,'' said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the
darkening grounds. ``It happens, sometimes... when somebody has suffered a... loss.''
``Well,'' said Harry, refusing to be deflected. ``You were right, Ive - Ive come to find you.''
Nick said nothing.
``Its -'' said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had anticipated, ``its just - youre dead. But youre still here, arent you?''
Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds.
``Thats right, isnt it?'' Harry urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``You died, but Im talking to you... you can walk around Hogwarts and everything, cant you?''
``Yes,'' said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, ``I walk and talk, yes.''
``So, you came back, didnt you?'' said Harry urgently. ``People can come back, right? As ghosts.
They dont have to disappear completely. Well?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) added impatiently, when Nick continued to
say nothing.
Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, ``Not everyone can come back as a ghost.''
``What dyou mean?'' said Harry quickly
``Only... only wizards.''
``Oh,'' said Harry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) almost laughed with relief. ``Well, thats okay then, the person Im asking about is a wizard. So he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) can come back, right?''
Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) wont come back.''
``Who?''
``Sirius Black,'' said Nick.
``But you did!'' said Harry angrily. ``You came back - youre dead and you didnt disappear -''
``Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living
selves once trod,'' said Nick miserably. ``But very few wizards choose that path.''
``Why not?'' said Harry. ``Anyway - it doesnt matter - Sirius wont care if its unusual, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)ll come back, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) will!''
And so strong was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) belief, Harry actually turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head to check the door, sure, for a split
second, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to see Sirius, pearly-white and transparent but beaming, walking
through it towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>).
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) will not come back,'' repeated Nick. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) will have... gone on.''
``What dyou mean, gone on?'' said Harry quickly ``Gone on where? Listen - what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you go? Why doesnt everyone come back? Why isnt this place full of ghosts? Why -?''
``I cannot answer,'' said Nick.
``Youre dead, arent you?'' said Harry exasperatedly. ``Who can answer better than you?''
``I was afraid of death,'' said Nick softly. ``I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtnt to have... well, that is neither here nor there... in fact, I am neither here nor there...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) gave a small sad chuckle. ``I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of
Mysteries -''
``Dont talk to me about that place!'' said Harry fiercely.
``I am sorry not to have been more help,'' said Nick gently ``Well... well, do excuse me... the
feast, you know...''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at the wall through which Nick
had disappeared.
Harry felt almost as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) godfather all over again in losing the hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
might be able to see or speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) once more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked slowly and miserably back up
through the empty castle, wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would ever feel cheerful again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had turned the corner towards the Fat Ladys corridor when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw somebody up ahead
fastening a note to a board on the wall. A second glance showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) it was Luna. There were no
good hiding places nearby, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was bound to have heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) footsteps, and in any case, Harry
could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment.
``Hello,'' said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) stepped back from the notice.
``How come youre not at the feast?'' Harry asked.
``Well, Ive lost most of my possessions,'' said Luna serenely. ``People take them and hide them,
you know. But as its the last night, I really do need them back, so Ive been putting up signs.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) gestured towards the noticeboard, upon which, sure enough, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had pinned a list of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
missing books and clothes, with a plea for their return.
An odd feeling rose in Harry; an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) since Siriuss death. It was a few moments before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was feeling sorry for
Luna.
``How come people hide your stuff?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), frowning.
``Oh... well...'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) shrugged. ``I think they think Im a bit odd, you know. Some people call me
Loony Lovegood, actually.''
Harry looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully.
``Thats no reason for them to take your things,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said flatly. ``Dyou want help finding them?''
``Oh, no,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said, smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Theyll come back, they always do in the end. It was just that I wanted to pack tonight. Anyway... why arent you at the feast?''
Harry shrugged. ``Just didnt feel like it.''
``No,'' said Luna, observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) with those oddly misty, protuberant eyes. ``I dont suppose you
do. That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather, wasnt he (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>)? Ginny told me.''
Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not mind Luna talking about Sirius.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) had just remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), too, could see Thestrals.
``Have you...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) began. ``I mean, who... has anyone you known ever died?''
``Yes,'' said Luna simply, ``my mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a quite extraordinary witch, you know, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did like to experiment and one of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spells went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.''
``Im sorry'' Harry mumbled.
``Yes, it was rather horrible,'' said Luna conversationally. ``I still feel very sad about it sometimes. But Ive still got Dad. And anyway, its not as though Ill never see Mum again, is it?''
``Er - isnt it?'' said Harry uncertainly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) head in disbelief.
``Oh, come on. You heard them, just behind the veil, didnt you?''
``You mean...''
``In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of sight, thats all. You heard them.''
They looked at each other. Luna was smiling slightly. Harry did not know what to say, or to
think; Luna believed so many extraordinary things... yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) had been sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) had heard voices
behind the veil, too.
``Are you sure you dont want me to help you look for your stuff?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) said.
``Oh, no,'' said Luna. ``No, I think Ill just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to
turn up... it always does in the end... well, have a nice holiday Harry''
``Yeah... yeah, you too.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) walked away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) go, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>) found that the terrible weight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luna</b></font>)
stomach- seemed to have lessened slightly.
The journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in several ways. Firstly
Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike
without teacher witnesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
way back from the toilet. The attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they
unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of D.A. members, who saw
what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to Harrys aid. By the time Ernie
Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein and Terry
Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had taught them, Malfoy,
Crabbe and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts
uniforms as Harry, Ernie and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to
ooze.
``I must say, Im looking forward to seeing Malfoys mothers face when he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) gets off the train,'' said Ernie, with some satisfaction, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernie</b></font>) watched Malfoy squirm above him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>). Ernie had never quite got over the indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernie</b></font>) brief spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad.
``Goyles mumll be really pleased, though,'' said Ron, who had come to investigate the source of the commotion. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)s loads better looking now... anyway, Harry, the food trolleys just stopped if you want anything...''
Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their compartment, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bought a
large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties. Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again, Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler and Neville was stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched.
Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out
snippets from the Prophet. It was now full of articles about how to repel Dementors, attempts by
the Ministry to track down Death Eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen
Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning...
``It hasnt really started yet,'' sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again. ``But it
wont be long now...''
``Hey, Harry'' said Ron softly, nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor.
Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing
a balaclava. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Chos eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked
back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pawns chased off its square by Rons
knight.
``Whats - er - going on with you and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), anyway?'' Ron asked quietly
``Nothing,'' said Harry truthfully.
``I - er - heard she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)s going out with someone else now,'' said Hermione tentatively.
Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all. Wanting to impress Cho
seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); so much of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
wanted before Sirius, death felt that way these days... the week that had elapsed since he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the
one with Sirius in it, and the one without.
``Youre well out of it, mate,'' said Ron forcefully. ``I mean, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)s quite good-looking and all that,
but you want someone a bit more cheerful.''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)s probably cheerful enough with someone else,'' said Harry, shrugging.
``Whos she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with now, anyway?'' Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.
``Michael Corner,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) said.
``Michael - but -'' said Ron, craning around in hiss eat to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>). ``But you were going out
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>)!''
``Not any more,'' said Ginny resolutely. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) didnt like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at
Quidditch, and got really sulky, so I ditched him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) ran off to comfort Cho instead.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)
scratched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) nose absently with the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) quill, turned The Quibbler upside-down and began marking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) answers. Ron looked highly delighted.
``Well, I always thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) was a bit of an idiot,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, prodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) queen forwards towards
Harrys quivering castle. ``Good for you. Just choose someone - better - next time.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said it.
``Well, Ive chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)s better?'' asked Ginny vaguely.
``WHAT?'' shouted Ron, upending the chessboard: Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces
and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead.
As the train slowed down in the approach to Kings Cross, Harry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never wanted to
leave it less. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) simply refused to get off, but
remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back to
Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lifted down Hedwigs cage and
prepared to drag his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk from the train as usual.
When the ticket inspector signaled to Harry, Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through
the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) found a surprise awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) who he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had not expected at all.
There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) bowler hat pulled low over his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>)
magical eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) would have done without it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) body
wrapped in a voluminous traveling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bright bubble-gumpink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend The Weird Sisters. Next to Tonks was Lupin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) face pale, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) hair graying, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the front of the group stood Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new jackets in some lurid green, scaly material.
``Ron, Ginny!'' called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying forwards and hugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) children tightly ``Oh, and Harry dear - how are you?''
``Fine,'' lied Harry, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) into a tight embrace. Over her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) shoulder he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Ron goggling at the twins new clothes.
``What are they supposed to be?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) asked, pointing at the jackets.
``Finest dragonskin, little bro,'' said Fred, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) zip a little tweak. ``Business is booming and
we thought wed treat ourselves.''
``Hello, Harry'' said Lupin, as Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione.
``Hi,'' said Harry ``I didnt expect... what are you all doing here?''
``Well,'' said Lupin with a slight smile, ``we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home.''
``I dunno if thats a good idea,'' said Harry at once.
``Oh, I think it is,'' growled Moody, who had limped a little closer. ``Thatll be them, will it,
Potter?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pointed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thumb over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) magical eye was evidently peering through the
back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bowler hat. Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye
was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to
see Harrys reception committee.
``Ah, Harry'' said Mr. Weasley, turning from Hermione s parents, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) had just greeted
enthusiastically, and who were now taking it in turns to hug Hermione. ``Well - shall we do it,
then?''
``Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,'' said Moody.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) and Mr. Weasley took the lead across the station towards the Dursleys, who were apparently
rooted to the floor. Hermione disengaged herself gently from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mother to join the group.
``Good afternoon,'' said Mr. Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) came to a halt right in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>). ``You might remember me, my names Arthur Weasley''
As Mr. Weasley had single-handedly demolished most o f the Dursleys living room two years
previously, Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>). Sure
enough, Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, but chose not to
say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia
looked both frightened and embarrassed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody
she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) knew would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to look small
and insignificant, a feat at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) was failing extravagantly.
``We thought wed just have a few words with you about Harry,'' said Mr. Weasley, still smiling.
``Yeah,'' growled Moody. ``About how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s treated when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)s at your place.''
Uncle Vernons moustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possibly because the bowler hat
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) the entirely mistaken impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) was dealing with a kindred spirit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) addressed
himself to Moody.
``I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house -''
``I expect what youre not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,'' growled Moody.
``Anyway, thats not the point,'' interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) eyes rather than look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>). ``The point is, if we find out youve been horrible to Harry -<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>- And make no mistake, well hear about it,'' added Lupin pleasantly.
``Yes,'' said Mr. Weasley, ``even if you wont let Harry use the fellytone -''
``Telephone,<div class="bookquote">'' whispered Hermione.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/James</b></font>)</div>- Yeah, if we get any hint that Potters been mistreated in any way, youll have us to answer to,''
said Moody.
Uncle Vernon swelled ominously. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) fear of this
bunch of oddballs.
``Are you threatening me, sir?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) said, so loudly t hat passers-by actually turned to stare.
``Yes, I am,'' said Mad-Eye, who seemed rather pleased that Uncle Vernon had grasped this fact
so quickly.
``And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?'' barked Uncle Vernon.
``Well...'' said Moody, pushing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) bowler hat to reveal his (<font color='blue'><b>Moody</b></font>) sinisterly revolving magical eye.
Uncle Vernon leapt backwards in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley. ``Yes, Id
have to say you do, Dursley''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) turned away from Uncle Vernon to survey Harry.
``So, Potter... give us a shout if you need us. If we dont hear from you for three days in a row,
well send someone along...''
Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously. It could not have been plainer that she (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) was thinking of what
the neighbors would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path.
``Bye, then, Potter,'' said Moody, grasping Harrys shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand.
``Take care, Harry,'' said Lupin quietly. ``Keep in touch.''
``Harry, well have you away from there as soon as we can,'' Mrs. Weasley whispered, hugging
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupin</b></font>) again.
``Well see you soon, mate,'' said Ron anxiously, shaking Harrys hand.
``Really soon, Harry'' said Hermione earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``We promise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Harry nodded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), to see them
all ranged there, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) side. Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around and led
the way out of the station towards the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley
hurrying along in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) wake.
